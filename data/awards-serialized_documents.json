["id is /awards/1U54DK107967/, type are Award, Item, description is PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal seeks to fulfill a community need for a comprehensive, high-resolution genome-mapping platform that will enable investigation of the structural, functional and spatiotemporal organization of the human genome. Our ultimate goal is to deliver complex chromatin interaction network maps in the context of 3D genome structures from which the dynamics of individual genomic elements can be monitored and referenced. Here, we propose to develop a Nucleome Positioning System (NPS)-comprised of 1) a robust genome- wide mapping technology platform, 2) advanced computational modeling algorithms and 3) state-of-the-art nuclear imaging methods-that will allow users community-wide to uncover the regulatory functions of 3D genome organization in human cells. NPS will be based upon the established ChIA-PET method (1,2), enhanced by process optimizations-i.e., microfluidic-based miniaturization and Tn5-transposase-based library preparation-to facilitate the study of chromatin interactions mediated by protein factors across a broader range of human cell types (Aim 1, see also Mapping Technology Development Component). We will also optimize RICh-PET for the comprehensive mapping of chromatin interactions mediated by non-coding RNAs (Aim 1). The high-quality mapping data generated through these optimization efforts will be analyzed by a new computational platform (Three-Dimensional Nucleome Modeling Engine, or 3D-NOME) that makes use of hierarchical multi-scaling to model 3D genome structures (Aim 2, Data Analysis and Modeling component). We will also complement the 3D modeling with transcriptome, epigenome and SNP data associated with genetic diseases (GWAS) to provide functional annotation to structural units (Aim 2). We will continue by developing strategies to validate the nucleome geometry predicted by 3D-NOME both structurally, using new nuclear imaging technologies, and functionally, using cutting-edge genome- and epigenome-editing approaches, in both human cell lines and mouse models (Aim 3, Biological Validation Component). Finally, we will implement NPS to generate pilot 3D genome maps from a wide range of human cell lines and primary immune cells sorted from whole blood, to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of human genome organization over major developmental and hematopoietic cell lineages, as well as among differentiating lymphocytes involved in the immune response (Aim 4, Data Generation Component). Together, these efforts will yield a powerful set of sophisticated, high-quality tools and mapping data for the larger research community, and will help establish the standards for future 3D/4D nucleome studies. They will also provide insights into the broad mechanisms that organize the structure and regulate the function of the human genome, as well as the specific mechanisms by which immune responses are regulated at the nuclear level., pi  title is Yijun Ruan, rfa is community, title is NUCLEOME POSITIONING SYSTEM FOR SPATIOTEMPORAL GENOME ORGANIZATION AND REGULATION", "id is /awards/U01HG009391/, type are Award, Item, description is Repetitive transposable elements (TEs) comprise over 50% of the human genome. While some investigators regard TEs as \u201cparasitic\u201d DNA, other studies suggest that TEs play a more constructive role in genome evolution by providing raw material for new biological functions. For example, TEs commonly harbor active cis-regulatory elements that are occasionally co-opted during evolution to wire new gene regulatory networks. While investigators now recognize the importance of TEs in gene regulation, TEs remain under-analyzed in high-throughput data because of methodological hurdles associated with their repetitive nature. Thus, the impact of TEs on the regulation of the human genome, both in normal development and disease, remains largely uncharacterized. We propose to develop novel computational methods to assess and clarify the impact of TEs in regulatory innovation using ENCODE data. In Specific Aim 1 we will develop new algorithms and statistical methods to predict active regulatory elements encoded by TEs from heterogeneous ENCODE data. If successful, we will generate a profile of TE-derived regulatory elements and their predicted targets across diverse cell/tissue types and developmental stages, revealing new gene regulatory networks wired by TEs. With these new methods we also intend to examine the extent of TE dysregulation in cancer cells and its transcriptional consequences. In Specific Aim 2 we will extend the models developed in Aim 1 to understand the role of TEs in shaping the 3D topology of the genome, which is intimately connected to genome function. We will investigate the role of TEs in partitioning the genome into chromosomal domains that orchestrate communication between cis-regulatory elements and their target genes. In particular, we will quantify the extent to which TEs drive conservation and divergence in genome topology across mammal species. In Specific Aim 3 we will take advantage of the repetitive nature of TEs to develop a novel statistical model that links sequence changes in different copies of TEs to epigenetic and functional differences. The numerous, but slightly different copies of a TE present in a single genome provide a unique opportunity to identify sequence variants that underlie epigenetic modification, which will further our understanding of how TEs become co-opted for host gene regulation. Finally, in Specific Aim 4, we will deploy our recently developed Repeat Element Browser as a web portal and downloadable application specifically tailored for investigators to analyze, visualize and explore data produced by ENCODE, others, and their own data in the context of TEs. The methods developed in this proposal will have a high impact on the utility of the data produced by ENCODE and will greatly expand our understanding of the contribution of TEs to non-coding regulatory elements in healthy tissues and disease., pi  title is Ting Wang, rfa is ENCODE4, title is CONNECTING TRANSPOSABLE ELEMENTS AND REGULATORY INNOVATION USING ENCODE DATA", "id is /awards/U01HG009417/, type are Award, Item, description is The goal of this project is to functionally annotate genetic variants in post-transcriptional regulation of RNA expression, which extends and complements the current focus of ENCODE data analysis. Recently, tremendous success has been achieved in constructing a catalog of genetic variants in disease genomes or across population. The next great challenge is to identify causal variants and elucidate their potential function in biological and disease processes. To this end, research efforts have been directed to studying variants located in protein-coding, promoter, and splice site regions due to their apparent impacts on gene expression. However, many of the newly identified disease-associated variants reside in other non-coding regions, such as introns, that may confer regulatory function to the related gene. The mechanisms of these variants have been hard to decipher. It is expected that many of them may function at the post-transcriptional level, thus affecting mRNA expression. In human, a myriad of processes mediate RNA expression at the post-transcriptional stage, such as splicing, editing, polyadenylation and mRNA decay. Post-transcriptional regulation is extremely versatile, yet closely regulated, affecting most human genes. Despite the importance, how to accurately identify functional genetic variants in these processes remains a key question in the field. To address this question, the large collection of ENCODE expression and protein-binding data represent an invaluable resource. We will develop novel methodologies to make full use of the ENCODE and other publicly available data sets, complemented by further bioinformatic prediction and experimental validations. This work will allow a previously unattained level of understanding of genetic variants in post-transcriptional regulation of RNA expression and provide new means to tackle the imperative task of functional annotations of genetic variants., pi  title is Xinshu Grace Xiao, rfa is ENCODE4, title is ANALYSIS OF FUNCTIONAL GENETIC VARIANTS IN RNA PROCESSING AND EXPRESSION", "id is /awards/U41HG009889/, type are Award, Item, description is The objective of the ENCORE (Encyclopedia of RNA Elements) Consortium is to develop a foundational, functional map of protein-RNA interactions of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) encoded in the human genome, and the RNA elements they bind to across the transcriptome. These RNA elements, when expressed, form the basis of co- and post-transcriptional regulation of human genes. Our strategy consists of developing and integrating a physical map of 300 RBPs in two different human cell lines with transcriptome-wide measurements of the effects of depleting these RBPs, their localization patterns and their binding preferences independent of co-factor associations. Over the past 4 years, our consortium (Burge, Graveley, Lecuyer and Yeo) has established highly efficient data production workflows of experimental methods (RNA bind-n-seq, RNA-seq, Localization and enhanced CLIP) that will enable us to immediately expand these datasets, which form a crucial and missing link to decipher the mechanisms of post-trancriptional regulation and how these impact genetic variation and disease etiology. When combined with the data we generated over the past four years, these efforts will culminate in a comprehensive map of the functional RNA elements recognized by essentially all RBPs expressed in two human cell lines, representing approximately half of the known complement of human RBPs. ENCORE will (1) generate and validate a physical resource of cell lines expressing epitope-tagged RBPs, (2) develop transcriptomics and imaging databases of these RBPs to provide simple interfaces for the community to mine this resource, (3) develop and distribute workflows for integrative analyses and shareable results from these workflows and (4) provide training and outreach to establish ENCORE annotations as the standard reference for co- and post-transcriptional research and clinical genomics efforts in the long-term., pi  title is Brenton Graveley, rfa is ENCODE4, title is A COMPREHENSIVE FUNCTIONAL MAP OF HUMAN PROTEIN-RNA INTERACTIONS", "id is /awards/UM1HG009393/, type are Award, Item, description is Specific enhancers interact with promoters to specify the cellular pattern, timing, and levels of gene expression. Enhancers can reside up to megabases away from their target gene promoters and strongly activate transcription. Aim 1 will characterize active enhancer elements and their relationship to promoter elements in vivo in human K562 (a tier 1 ENCODE cell line) by testing a broad array of Transcription Regulatory Elements (TREs) for their enhancer activity using eSTARR-seq, our modified element-clone- compatible STARR-seq assay. This collection of TREs will be selected based on a variety of criteria established by ENCODE and others. Large numbers of selected TREs can be handled using our new Clone- seq method, and then tested for enhancer activity by eSTARR-seq. For the TREs that have significant enhancer activity, ~10,000 synthetic mutations will be generated that are designed to destroy distinct TF binding motifs found within each enhancer. We will generate mutant clones using our en masse Clone-seq2 method and examine their impact on enhancer activity using eSTARR-seq. These data will be used to understand the underlying molecular architecture and function of enhancers and promoters. Aim 2 generates K562 cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 that contain critical synthetic enhancer mutations identified in Aim 1. PRO- seq assays can then be used to measure with high sensitivity and resolution the transcription at the variant enhancers as well as all TREs and transcription units genome-wide. This will reveal the role of DNA sequence motifs within native enhancer loci in the regulatory crosstalk with distal gene promoters and enhancers. Circularized Chromosome Conformation Capture (4C) experiments with particular enhancers as the anchor site will provide an unbiased analysis of distal interactions, while targeted ChIP-qPCR experiments will test effects of these mutant enhancers on transcription factor binding and local histone marks at these genomic points of enhancer interaction. Thus, Aim 2 rigorously characterizes mutated enhancers from Aim 1 in their native chromatin environment. Aim 3 characterizes the de novo activation of enhancers, which are known to be triggered by the heat shock activation of HSF1, a master regulator. Because the sequence motif, HSE, to which HSF1 binds is well defined, targeted HSE mutations that cripple the enhancer activity will be made immediately using CRISPR at native loci and the effects on transcription genome-wide can be analyzed directly by PRO-seq. Additional critical motifs in these inducible enhancers will be identified in a less biased way by the more laborious, but high-throughput, eSTARR-seq approach described in Aim 1. Finally, tracking the kinetics with which the structural characteristics of these enhancers form in the minutes following heat shock relative to the induced transcriptional activity as measured by PRO-seq allows assessment of which characteristics (DNase I hypersensitivity, histone modifications, binding of HSF1 and other TFs, and eRNA production) correlate with functional transcription effects on distal promoters and other enhancers., pi  title is John Lis, rfa is ENCODE4, title is HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF HUMAN ENHANCERS", "id is /awards/UM1HG009408/, type are Award, Item, description is Since its inception in 2003, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium has made remarkable progress towards the identification of all functional elements in the human genome. However, major limitations of the current catalog are that the vast majority of elements have not been functionally characterized, the impact of genetic variation on their function is poorly defined, the precise levels of activation or repression that they confer remain unmeasured, and the specific gene(s) that they regulate are not definitively known. To address these gaps, we will implement `in genome' massively parallel functional assays to characterize over 100,000 ENCODE-based candidate regulatory elements, to confirm and quantify their activities as well as to link many of them to their target genes. In a systematic comparison of episomal vs. genomic massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA), we show that episomal assays fail to accurately capture the full patterns of regulatory activity that are observed in the context of chromatin. We therefore focus exclusively on methods that test candidate regulatory elements in an integrated, `in genome' context. First, using lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assays, we will characterize at least 100,000 ENCODE-based regulatory elements for their promoter/enhancer activity while integrated into the genome (lentiMPRA; Aim 1a). Importantly, lentiMPRA can be carried out in almost every cell type and leverages ongoing developments in lentivirus technology. Early results will be used to iteratively develop models that make better selections for subsequent rounds of functional characterization. Second, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 and multiplex homology directed repair to integrate a subset of candidate enhancers to the 3' UTR of transcriptionally inactive genes, allowing us to further validate and characterize their ability to activate transcription in a natural genomic context (`in genome' STARR-seq; Aim 1b). Finally, we will implement a new paradigm involving CRISPR/Cas9-based multiplex genome editing followed by RNA-seq/ATAC-seq molecular profiling to characterize a genome-wide subset of candidate regulatory elements in their native genomic context for the functional consequences of mutations on them, while also determining the target gene(s) that they regulate (massively parallel genome editing; Aim 2). Although we will initially focus our efforts on K562 and HepG2 cells, we will also perform work in other cell lines as appropriate for the needs of the ENCODE Consortium, with 25% of our capacity dedicated to a common set of elements. Combined with the efforts of the other functional characterization centers, our work will provide unprecedented `in genome' validation and characterization of ENCODE-defined candidate regulatory elements, while also facilitating insights into our understanding of the basic biology of gene regulation and how regulatory variants contribute to human disease risk., pi  title is Jay Shendure, rfa is ENCODE4, title is MASSIVELY PARALLEL REPORTER ASSAYS AND GENOME EDITING OF ENCODE PREDICTED REGULATORY ELEMENTS", "id is /awards/UM1HG009443/, type are Award, Item, description is It is said that if the genome represents the set of things that the cell could say, then the transcriptome represents the set of things that the cell is saying right now. The transcriptome is the primary read-out of the genome and is composed mainly of mRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and microRNAs. At all stages of life, in health and in disease, differences in the transcriptome causally define and distinguish each cell type and cell state. The mission of the ENCODE Consortium is to discover, map and define all genes and their regulatory elements. RNA-Seq data and the resulting transcriptomes have therefore been a prominent component of prior phases of ENCODE, and our groups have contributed over 350 released poly(A) mRNA and microRNA datasets for the project. Valuable and high quality as those data are, we are new technologies will allow us to produce a new generation of transcriptomes that are much more information rich and definitive. Specifically, they resolve the multiple different cell types that comprise complex tissues, and they resolve the molecular isoforms in the data. They qualitatively document long-range single molecule splicing and end processing and we provide companion quantification of microRNAs, plus discovery of their often-undocumented precursor RNAs. Finally, we map RNA secondary structure across the transcriptome in vivo. We propose to contribute 300 new, higher precision transcriptomes containing these measurement types and their integrated analysis. A portion of this study focuses on aging humans and mice, a whole life cycle stage that has not previously been studied in ENCODE. The corresponding disease component will contrast the cognitively normal old with Alzheimers dementia in the brain and in the motor system., pi  title is Barbara Wold, rfa is ENCODE4, title is HIGHER PRECISION HUMAN AND MOUSE TRANSCRIPTOMES", "id is /awards/UM1HG009409/, type are Award, Item, description is Efforts to map the functional elements of the human genome, which include elements such as insulators, enhancers, promoters and transcriptional start sites, have historically treated the genome as linear. However, it is now well appreciated that the genome has a three-dimensional (3D) organization that is important for mediating functional associations between regulatory elements and gene-coding sequences. Thus a linear map provides an incomplete picture of the genome, and it is often difficult or impossible to infer functional associations between regulatory elements without a topological framework to provide context. We have developed and advanced a powerful, high-resolution method for providing such a topological framework, Chromatin Interaction Analysis using Paired-End Tag sequencing (ChIA-PET). Using ChIA-PET, we have demonstrated that specific DNA motifs bound by CCCTC-binding Factor (CTCF) are critical in defining topological domains and arranging the gene positions for coordinated transcription mediated by RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII). Therefore, the combination of CTCF and RNAPII ChIA-PET will be effective for comprehensively mapping the major structure codes and topological organization that scaffold RNAPII- associated transcriptional regulation. We will contribute ChIA-PET technology to the ENCODE Project to both strengthen existing ENCODE datasets and identify new \u201cstructure code\u201d elements and their interplays with gene-coding sequences that will aid in understanding the transcriptional landscape of the genome. We have established a robust ChIA-PET pipeline from library production to data processing for human and mouse cells. Here, we propose to apply this platform to assay large numbers of cell lines and primary cells that represent a wide-range of cellular space with important biological significance. Based on our current production scale and estimated budget allocation, we aim to produce 1024 high quality datasets from CTCF and RNAPII ChIA-PET experiments, each with two biological replicates for 256 biological samples. This pipeline capacity will be applied to samples selected by the ENCODE Consortium, and to this sample pool we aim to contribute a collection of high value biological samples that are likely of common interest to both the Consortium and the greater research community. These samples include both primary and in vitro\u2013differentiated human blood cells, healthy and diseased induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), mature neurons differentiated from the iPSCs, and several major cell and tissue types from healthy and disease-model mice. These samples were selected to expand the \u201ccell space\u201d explored by the ENCODE Project and also because ChIA-PET analyses will be particularly relevant for revealing fundamental biology., pi  title is Yijun Ruan, rfa is ENCODE4, title is COMPREHENSIVE MAPPING OF LONG-RANGE CHROMATIN INTERACTIONS IN HUMAN AND MOUSE GENOMES", "id is /awards/UM1HG009444/, type are Award, Item, description is The overall mission of this Mapping Center is to create and disseminate open access, comprehensive, high-quality, high-resolution reference maps of DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) in the human and mouse genomes, at previously unattainable levels of cellular and anatomical definition. Regulatory DNA is actuated in an exceptionally state-specific manner;\u037e accordingly, achieving a comprehensive map of DHSs necessitates the interrogation of an expansive and finely partitioned range of cell and tissue samples. Progressive technical improvements and recent innovations have resulted in dramatic (>100x) decreases in requisite input biological sample quantities coupled with equally dramatic (>100x) increases in assay throughput, and corresponding decreases in the incremental cost of generating reference-quality DHS maps. These advances have in turn opened the possibility of systematically addressing all well-defined physiologically and disease-relevant anatomic and cellular compartments. Four major Specific Aims are targeted: (1) To create open access, comprehensive high-quality, high- resolution reference maps of human DNase I hypersensitive sites\u037e (2) To create and disseminate comprehensive high-quality, high-resolution reference maps of mouse DNase I hypersensitive sites\u037e (3) To maintain and disseminate reference indices of DNase I hypersensitive sites and footprints in the human and mouse genomes\u037e and (4) To enable large-scale intake of Consortium and Community samples for high-quality, high-throughput DHS mapping., pi  title is John Stamatoyannopoulos, rfa is ENCODE4, title is ENCODE MAPPING CENTER-A COMPREHENSIVE CATALOG OF DNASE I HYPERSENSITIVE SITES", "id is /awards/U01HG003147/, type are Award, Item, description is A working draft of the human genome has been completed. Transcription of RNA is one of the functional processes which permit the transfer of encoded information from the DNA sequence into function. Recent evidence suggests that the catalogue of transcripts that are made for the human genome is more complex than indicated by current annotations. The locations and characteristics of regulatory elements encoded in the genome which control the expression of these transcripts are even less well understood. The goal of this proposal is to describe a collection of generic and unbiased strategies which can be used, on a genome-wide scale, to locate the sites of transcription and the functional elements which regulate RNA expression. These strategies have high density oligonucleotide arrays and chromatin immunoprecipation (CHIP) as core technologies that will enable the mapping of these sites. For the first year of our proposed ENCODE project, 30 Mb of distributed genomic sequence (approximately 1% of genome) selected from 44 different chromosomal locations ranging in size from 500 kb to 2 Mb will serve as target sequences. A single array with approximately 810,000 probe pairs that interrogate the 30 Mb of sequence at every 37 bp, on average, will be synthesized and used as a common platform to map the locations of both transcription and functional regulatory elements. The functional elements which will be monitored are the binding sites for 15 transcription factors and 4 repressors as well as the locations for 7 types of histone modifications which have been correlated with RNA regulation. Three well-characterized phorbol ester or retinoic acid- responsive cell lines (Jurkat, NCCIT and HL-60) will be temporally monitored when activated by these molecules and will provide the biological context for these studies. To demonstrate the scalability of this collection of strategies, the second and third years of our proposed studies will be focused on constructing a similar collection of maps, at a resolution of 35 bp on average, but across the entire human genome., pi  title is Thomas Gingeras, rfa is ENCODE, title is MAPPING SITES OF TRANSCRIPTION AND REGULATION", "id is /awards/R35GM124820/, type are Award, Item, description is PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have discovered thousands of genetic variations that are associated with hundreds of complex human diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms of how these variants contribute to disease pathogenesis remain obscure. One of the main hurdles is that the majority of disease-associated variants identified are located in the non-coding regions, whose annotations and functions are traditionally poorly understood. Thanks to recent efforts by the ENCODE and Epigenome Roadmap projects, we have identified millions of potential non-coding regulatory elements in the human genome, mainly based on high-throughput assays such as DNase-Seq or ChIP-Seq data. More importantly, it has been shown that 77% of the disease-associated SNPs are located within a potential regulatory region. However, there have been very few studies in which functional experiments were properly performed to elucidate how SNPs can disrupt the function of a distal regulatory element and influence the phenotypes. Another daunting task is how to identify target genes for the distal regulatory elements that harbor the disease-associated SNP. This is a challenging problem because enhancers can work from either upstream or downstream of their target genes, and can be located as far as 1 million base pairs away and still function through chromatin looping. High-throughput methods based on Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) have emerged (such as Hi-C and ChIA-PET, and Capture Hi-C) and represent an unprecedented opportunity to study higher-order chromatin structure genome-wide. However, data analysis and interpretation for 3C types of data are still in their early stages, and the complex relationship between chromatin interactions and gene regulation has just started to be unraveled. The mechanisms of how TADs, sub-TADs and domain boundaries are formed remains unclear. On the other hand, the impact of 3D structure on gene transcript and epigenetic landscape is also largely unknown and whether they are the cause or the consequence of 3D genome structure is yet to be explored as well. Given the aforementioned challenges and my unique multi-disciplinary training, my long-term goal is to use a combination of high throughput genomic experiments, computational modeling, and functional assays to address the following fundamental questions: 1) How to identify non-coding causal variants for human diseases? 2) What is the molecular mechanism for the formation of 3D genome organization? 3) What is the impact of 3D genome organization on gene regulation and human diseases? The proposed work will deepen our understanding on how genetic variants contribute to gene regulation, 3D genome organization and molecular mechanisms underlying human diseases., pi  title is Feng Yue, rfa is community, title is IMPACT OF GENETIC VARIANTS ON GENE REGULATION AND 3D GENOME ORGANIZATION IN HUMAN DISEASES", "id is /awards/U01HG009395/, type are Award, Item, description is Most of the 1000s of sequencing experiments generated by ENCODE provide 1D readouts of the epigenetic landscape or transcriptional output of a 3D genome. New chromosome conformation capture (3C) technologies \u2013 in particular Hi-C and ChIA-PET \u2013 have begun to provide insight into the hierarchical 3D organization of the genome: the partition of chromosomes into open and closed compartments; the existence of structural subunits defined as topologically associated domains (TADs); and the presence of regulatory and structural DNA loops within TADs. New experimental evidence using CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome editing suggests that disruption of local 3D structure can alter regulation of neighboring genes, and there have been early efforts to use data on 3D DNA looping to predict the impact of non-coding SNPs from GWAS studies. The goal of this proposal is to develop new integrative computational methods to interpret large-scale ENCODE 1D epigenomic and transcriptomic resources in light of the underlying 3D architecture of the genome. Members of our team have pioneered powerful methods to infer local chromatin states from a 1D viewpoint through the Segway suite. We have also analyzed the 1D organization of chromatin accessible elements and their lineage dynamics to define the concept of regulatory complexity, and we presented a gene regulation model to predict gene expression changes in differentiation from the DNA content of active enhancers. Here we will build on these efforts to learn chromatin state and gene regulation models that incorporate information on hierarchical 3D genomic architecture, enabling us to predict how individual structural/regulatory elements contribute to 3D DNA looping and to gene expression. Mechanistic predictions will be experimentally validated in their native cell-type specific chromatin context using state-of-the-art genome editing, exploiting computational and experimental CRISPR/Cas tools developed by our team., pi  title is Christina Leslie, rfa is ENCODE4, title is ENCODING GENOMIC ARCHITECTURE IN THE ENCYCLOPEDIA: LINKING DNA ELEMENTS, CHROMATIN STATE, AND GENE EXPRESSION IN 3D", "id is /awards/UM1HG009390/, type are Award, Item, description is Project Summary The proposed project aims to fundamentally advance the ENCODE Consortium's catalog of functional sequence elements in the human genome. ENCODE has already established a seminal resource that is enabling human biology, genetics and disease research. However, progress towards the Consortium's goal of identifying all functional genomic elements has been constrained by modest assay throughput and by the fact that functional elements tend to be exquisitely context-specific, only declaring themselves in specific developmental intervals, in specific disease settings, or in specific cell types obscured by tissue heterogeneity. To overcome these limitations and hasten progress towards ENCODE goals, the proposed project will purify highly specialized cell types from normal human tissues and blood, from tumors and other disease specimens, and from laboratory 'organoid' models that faithfully recapitulate developing brain, kidney or gut. These purified cell types will be applied to a multiplexed pipeline capable of acquiring genome-wide chromatin state maps with unprecedented throughput and low cost. Thousands of maps reflecting different chromatin modifications in different cell types will be integrated to derive a comprehensive set of sequence elements in the human genome, annotated by their predicted functions and cell type-specificities. The project will bring together a diverse team of experts in human biology and development, chromatin biology, genomics, and production research. This scientific team will coordinate closely with other Data Production, Coordination, Analysis and Functional Characterization Centers in the Encode Consortium to assemble a common catalog of the locations and cell type-specific functions of regulatory elements in the human genome. These annotations, and all primary data collected in the project, will be made freely available to the scientific community, with the goal to catalyze biomedical research and advance genomic medicine., pi  title is Bradley Bernstein, rfa is ENCODE4, title is A CATALOG OF CELL TYPES AND GENOMIC ELEMENTS IN TISSUES, ORGANOIDS AND DISEASE", "id is /awards/UM1HG009442/, type are Award, Item, description is Although our ability to determine the genome sequence of individuals is becoming facile, our understanding of the function of most of the human genome is limited. Mapping of regulatory information is particularly crucial since most (>85%) common variants associated with human disease lie outside of coding regions. Previous phases of ENCODE have made important contributions to the mapping of regulatory elements across the genome, but there is much more to be acheived, including the mapping of regulatory regions across many more tissues and at the resolution of individual cells as well as determining the exact regulators i.e. transcription factors that bind each region. In our Stanford ENCODE Production Center for Mapping of Regulatory Regions, we plan to use technologies that we have developed to map the binding sites for most transcription factors (TFs) in five major cell lines using chromatin immunoprecipitation of tagged TFs. We will further expand the catalog of regulatory elements by analyzing open chromatin regions in these cell lines and a wide variety of tissues and cell types from both normal and diseased human subjects consented for open access. Finally, we will map open chromatin regions in single cells from these types of biosamples. These studies will greatly expand the catalog of regulatory regions in the human genome. The rapid deposition of data into the ENCODE Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will ensure quick public release. We expect the data and cell lines that are generated by this Center will be a valuable resource for the broad scientific community., pi  title is Michael Snyder, rfa is ENCODE4, title is PRODUCTION CENTER FOR MAPPING REGULATORY REGIONS OF THE HUMAN GENOME", "id is /awards/U01DA025956/, type are Award, Item, description is High-density microarrays and next-generation sequencing technologies, coupled with the availability of the annotated human genomic sequence, are opening a road toward a comprehensive mapping of molecular epigenetic patterns. It is anticipated that comprehensive mapping and study of epigenetic patterns both \"horizontally\" along the genomic sequence and \"vertically\" across multiple differentiation and developmental stages and physiological conditions, will provide insights into human development, physiology, and disease. This vision of epigenomics calls both for novel organizational models suitable for high-throughput data-driven science and for innovative networked cyberinfrastructure. This project aims to develop such networked cyberinfrastructure and employ it to integrate and coordinate data analyses and data pipelines involving designated Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers (REMCs), NCBI, and other participants. The infrastructure builds on the now well established Genboree system which was developed in the context of numerous genome projects and has most recently been employed to coordinate the pilot stage of The Cancer Genome Atlas Project. The infrastructure will provide both scalability for further integration of new epigenomic technologies with increasing data production throughputs and adaptability to accommodate an increasing diversity of experimental and computational methodologies. Using the software-as-a-service model, web services, and semantic web technologies, the infrastructure will help integrate and coordinate efforts of REMCs, NCBI, and an increasing number of collaborating institutions and multi-disciplinary groups in the field of epigenomics working across geographic locations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Epigenomics is the study of heritable or stable changes in human cells that are not coded in the genomic DNA. The role of epigenomic changes in diseases as diverse as obesity, autism, and cancer is coming to light. Importantly, because epigenomic phenomena are affected by nutrition and environment, including maternal nutrition during pregnancy, increased understanding of epigenomics may lead to better health through changes in human nutrition and behavior. To better understand epigenomic phenomena in human health and disease, the NIH Roadmap Initiative in Epigenomics proposes comprehensive mapping and study of epigenomic patterns in human tissues at different developmental stages and physiological conditions. High-density microarrays and next-generation sequencing technologies, coupled with the availability of the annotated human genomic sequence, are opening a road toward a comprehensive mapping of such patterns. The amount and diversity of data produced will be very large and will require an informatic infrastructure for proper analysis. Building on the established Genboree system for collaborative genomic research over the Internet, this project aims to develop such a networked infrastructure, and employ it to integrate and to coordinate data analyses and data pipelines involving designated Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers and other participants in the NIH Roadmap Initiative in Epigenomics., pi  title is Aleksandar Milosavljevic, rfa is Roadmap, title is EPIGENOMICS DATA ANALYSIS AND COORDINATION CENTER AT BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE", "id is /awards/U01ES017166/, type are Award, Item, description is The human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a unique model system for investigating the mechanisms of human development due to their ability to replicate indefinitely while retaining the capacity to differentiate into a host of functionally distinct cell types. In addition, these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes, a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. In order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating differentiation of hESCs, and produce general reference epigenome maps of the human cells, we propose to establish an Epigenome Center in San Diego. Our center will be focused on both undifferentiated hESC and four hESC-derived early embryonic cell lineages including extraembryonic endoderm, trophoblast, mesendoderm (a common precursor to mesodermal and endodermal lineages), and mesenchymal cells (a specific mesoderm derivative). We have developed and validated high throughput technologies for mapping the state of DNA methylation and chromatin modifications throughout the genome, and will use these methods to generate high-resolution maps of the reference epigenomes. Specifically, we will grow and differentiate hESCs into multiple lineages, and map DNA methylation sites using a newly developed technology that combines bisulfite conversion and whole genome shotgun sequencing. We will also determine the histone modification status in the genome by performing both ChlP-chip and ChlP-Seq analysis. We will develop advanced statistical and algorithmic solutions to facilitate high-throughput sequencing data analysis, and establish an informatics pipeline for collecting, storage, and distribution of epigenome maps. Finally, we will perform integrated data analysis to identify new epigenetic patterns in the genome that could provide insights in mechanisms of epigenetic regulation., pi  title is Bing Ren, rfa is Roadmap, title is THE SAN DIEGO EPIGENOME CENTER", "id is /awards/ucsf-award-from-yin-shen/, type are Award, Item, description is Funded by UCSF from Yin Shen, pi  title is Yin Shen, rfa is community, title is UCSF award from Yin Shen", "id is /awards/UM1HG009382/, type are Award, Item, description is The ENCODE project has provided a tremendous resource for scientists with a treasure trove of data from a large set of different cell types describing RNA expression (RNA-seq), epigenetic signatures (ChIP-seq), chromatin structure (DNase-seq, ATAC-seq, Hi-C, ChIA-PET) and binding patterns of specific proteins to both DNA and RNA (ChIP-seq, CLIP-seq, RIP-seq). We have recently developed a set of techniques that are based on the specific labeling of nascent RNA with bromouridine (Bru) followed by lysis, capturing of the Bru-labeled RNA using specific antibodies and deep sequencing. Bru-seq captures the nascent RNA transcriptome, a signature of ongoing transcription in the genome where the relative rates of transcription of all genes can be obtained. In BruChase-seq, cells are labeled with Bru and then chased in uridine for different periods of time to allow for the determination of the relative stability of all transcripts are assessed. Finally, BruUV-seq allows for the capturing of RNA species that normally are rapidly turned over by the RNA exosome and can be used to map active enhancer elements producing eRNA genome-wide. In this UM1 grant application we are proposing to use these three Bru-seq techniques to obtain critical novel information on the nascent RNA transcriptome, RNA stabilome and active enhancome that will complement and enrich existing ENCODE data. We are proposing to focus our mapping efforts on two specific Aims: Aim 1: Obtain nascent RNA transcriptome, RNA stabilome and active enhancome data for human and mouse ENCODE cell lines. Aim 2: Obtain dynamic signatures of nascent transcription, RNA stability and activity of enhancer elements genome-wide following cellular exposure to environmental perturbations. The mapping efforts proposed in this UM1 grant application are seeking to identify novel candidate regulatory elements genome-wide that will complement and extend existing ENCODE data. Furthermore, dynamic studies will be initiated to assess the activities of regulatory elements during selected cell transitions and specific cellular responses. GOALS: The main goal of this proposal is to generate comprehensive novel data sets using our newly developed Bru-seq analysis platform that will complement and extend existing ENCODE data. The emphasis will be on mapping candidate functional elements in the human genome., pi  title is Mats Ljungman, rfa is ENCODE4, title is MAPPING OF NOVEL CANDIDATE FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS WITH BRU-SEQ TECHNOLOGY", "id is /awards/UM1HG009375/, type are Award, Item, description is The roughly two meters of DNA in the human genome is intricately packaged to form the chromatin and chromosomes in each cell nucleus. In addition to its structural role, this organization has critical regulatory functions. In particular, the formation of loops in the human genome plays an essential role in regulating genes. We recently demonstrated the ability to create reliable maps of these loops, using an in situ Hi-C method for three-dimensional genome sequencing. Hi-C characterizes the three dimensional configuration of the genome by determining the frequency of physical contact between all pairs of loci, genome-wide. The proposed center will apply Hi-C and other new technologies to characterize genomic loops, their regulation, and their functions. We will specifically examine these structures in a wide variety of ENCODE cell types. The principles deduced from our study will be applicable to any mammalian tissue type.  Aim 1 will apply Hi-C to 80 cell types to generate maps of loops genome-wide. Aim 2 will combine Hi-C data with existing ENCODE data in order to identify the specific DNA elements responsible for establishing each loop. Aim 3 will share these datasets through our Juicebox data visualization system.   The proposed project will advance our understanding of the determinants and functions of chromatin loops, provide a critical reference of loop structures in the human and mouse genomes, and present a technological framework for comprehensive analysis of genome folding in any cell type. It will also form a basis for studying the contribution of 3D genome structure to human disease and development., pi  title is Erez Aiden, rfa is ENCODE4, title is GENOME WIDE MAPPING OF LOOPS USING IN SITU HI-C", "id is /awards/U01HG009379/, type are Award, Item, description is Genetic discoveries from genome-wide association studies have led to important insights on human disease mechanisms. In particular, disease-associated variants are enriched in regions of the genome that are active in gene regulation. However, most of these analyses have focused on individual variants with the strongest evidence of association, and on broadly defined functional annotations, which provide limited scope for understanding disease mechanisms. In this proposal we analyze a broader set of genome-wide variants, in conjunction with functionally specialized annotations with potential mechanistic interpretations, such as context-specific regulatory elements or binding sites for specific transcription factors. We utilize methods that ascribe heritability to specific segments of the genome, leveraging polygenic signals distributed across the entire genome instead of a limited number of known genetic associations. These methods can pinpoint disease heritability to smaller and more specific subsets of the genome defined by precise context-specific functional annotations. In addition to highlighting specific mechanisms of disease, localizing to precise annotations will offer the ability to identify causal variants. We will take advantage of large databases of genetic data, in addition to a vast array of functional genomics data from ENCODE and other consortia. Specifically, we will (1) develop new statistical methods to partition disease heritability across functional categories, (2) build new annotations enriched for disease heritability from existing functional data sets, and (3) develop new computational methods to integrate ATAC-seq data with ENCODE data. The proposal represents a collaboration between Drs. Alkes Price, Soumya Raychaudhuri, and Nick Patterson, bringing together expertise in functional genomics, human disease genetics, and polygenic modeling. The investigators have a strong track record of integrating functional genomic data with human genetic data in recent publications., pi  title is Alkes Price, rfa is ENCODE4, title is FUNCTIONALLY SPECIALIZED COMPONENTS OF DISEASE HERITABILITY IN ENCODE DATA", "id is /awards/U41HG009293/, type are Award, Item, description is PROJECT SUMMARY The Human RegulomeDB project provides an essential resource that facilitates medical research and exploratory investigations of gene regulation. The majority of sequence variation identified in genome sequencing projects and disease association studies (GWAS) lie within the 98% of the human genome that is non-exomic. RegulomeDB is a unique web accessible resource that provides integrated knowledge of the wealth of existing information concerning regulatory elements that lie within non-exomic regions. The unique feature of this resource is its ability to comprehensively annotate, integrate and display the experimentally defined functional and biochemical regulatory elements of the human genome. Information generated from individual laboratories and consortia concerning potential regulatory regions such as that affecting gene expression, transcription factor binding, chromatin modification and DNA methylation will be collected from the literature, and integrated into a common database and displayed at nucleotide resolution. The information can be readily accessed via a web accessible interface and related to sequence variations identified from large scale projects (e.g. db SNPs, 1000 genome project, GWAS studies). Researchers will be able to compare variants identified from personal genomes and large scale sequencing projects as well as GWAS studies to the wealth of information in RegulomeDB, and thereby rapidly gain knowledge of non-exomic information. Given the wealth of DNA sequencing project that are emerging, we expect this unique resource to have wide impact in the biomedical community., pi  title is J.

We will accomplish this goal with three specific aims. We will develop novel Genome Syntax to Regulation (GSR) models that accurately learn a genomic regulatory vocabulary and predict how phrases in this vocabulary control chromatin accessibility (Aim 1). As part of this aim we will identify transcription factor binding motifs tha are in the discovered regulatory vocabulary. We will validate and refine the causality of these models by testing whether they accurately predict the chromatin accessibility of thousands of synthetic DNA \"phrases\" that have been engineered into specific genomic locations and measured in the context of transcription factor gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies. The phrases will be designed to elucidate both the factors and grammar that control chromatin opening in several distinct cellular states (Aim 2). We will use our predictive models to assign importance scores to individual genome bases and to predict how selected factors alter chromatin accessibility genome wide (Aim 3). We will test the ability of our importance scores to identify regulatory SNPs in the context of human genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, and we will validate model predictions of changes in whole genome chromatin accessibility in response to ectopic factor expression. Through computational modeling of the effect of such ectopic factor expression, we will develop a predictive understanding of how transcription factors alter chromatin state, laying the groundwork for a novel regenerative medicine paradigm of predictive cellular programming., pi  title is David Gifford, rfa is community, title is HIGH-THROUGHPUT METHODS FOR ELUCIDATING THE CONTROL OF CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY", "id is /awards/NSERC06150/, type are Award, Item, pi  title is Max Libbrecht, rfa is community, title is Unsupervised machine learning methods that discover the molecular programs underlying cellular biology", "id is /awards/U24HG009397/, type are Award, Item, description is The goals of the ENCODE Data Coordinating Center (DCC) is to support the ENCODE Consortium by defining and establishing a strategy that connects all participants to the data and by creating avenues of access that distribute these data to the greater biological research community. The ENCODE Consortium brings together laboratories that generate complex data types via experimental assays with laboratories that integrate these unique data using computational analyses to discover how chromosomal elements function together to define human cells and tissues. The DCC's participation enhances the data created by these laboratories through the creation of structured procedures for the verification and validation of all submitted data and providing processes for the documentation of metadata that describe each biological sample and assay method. To facilitate access to all the data created the DCC will construct a state of the art data warehouse. The DCC will design and development robust software to enhance the data submission and unified data processing pipelines, the organization and access to metadata and the data warehouse. In addition, we will develop and maintain the ENCODE Portal that will be the primary entry point to the wealth of experimentally determined information as well as results of computational analyses. The Portal will integrate these data resources and make them available via enhanced search and browsing capabilities. Tools will be implemented to aid discovery by both experienced bioinformaticians and na\u00efve laboratory staff. The DCC will evolve into a substantial service organization allowing biomedical research to take full advance of the ENCODE results. To this end the DCC will provide documentation via many media including written documentation, video tutorials, webinars, and meeting presentations. The DCC, DAC, production laboratories and AWG will be tightly woven together to create the ENCODE Consortium., pi  title is J. Michael Cherry, rfa is ENCODE4, title is A DATA COORDINATING CENTER FOR ENCODE", "id is /awards/U01HG007900/, type are Award, Item, description is Our current understanding of gene regulatory networks does not adequately utilize information from individual protein-DNA interactions and the millions of regulatory elements identified by high-throughput functional assays. New strategies are needed to incorporate data from each of these experimental scales, and to leverage the orthogonal datasets to understand how each regulatory element is involved in directing complex gene expression responses. The objective of our proposal is to develop statistical models to learn the underlying patterns of complex interactions involved in transcription regulation across the genome. While the genome-proximal response to glucocorticoid (GC) treatment is an ideal model system, the methods developed will be applicable to studying any complex regulatory network. The goal of Aim 1 will be to comprehensively characterize the first 12 hours of the GC response using genome-wide methods to quantify expression, TF binding, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, three-dimensional chromatin structure, and the function of regulatory elements. The outcome will be the most comprehensive and coordinated molecular description of a human regulatory network ever produced. All data will be generated with the highest possible quality standards, and will be submitted pre-publication and without restriction into the public domain. Aim 2 will integrate that data into a nonparametric and hierarchical Bayesian model of the GC response network (GCRN). That model will able to produce functional predictions for each individual regulatory element while also generalizing across genes to reveal shared principles of gene regulation. Aim 3 will validate and reduce uncertainty in the model. That will be accomplished by combining statistical experimental design approaches with multiplex genome and epigenome engineering to iteratively and optimally resolve the most uncertain aspects of the model. The outcome will be a validated and predictive model of the GCRN that will be useful to design customized genomic responses. Aim 4 will demonstrate the use of the resulting model through reprogramming the GCRN to minimize the response of genes associated with metabolism while maintaining the response of genes associated with inflammation and immunity. The outcome will be a derived cell line with a custom programmed GC response. That cell line will have immediate use for studying individual aspects of the GC response; and the approach used to design and realize the customized response will have broad implications for the study of other transcriptional response networks. The overall result of this project will be a mechanistic and actionable understanding of the principles through which individual DNA sequences contribute to the GCRN; a general and transferrable multi-scale modeling approach to study any complex regulatory network; and the novel ability to genetically reprogram transcriptional response networks to study their individual components. We anticipate that that outcome will have broad positive impact on both experimental and computational fields of biomedical research., pi  title is Tim Reddy, rfa is GGR, title is DECODING AND REPROGRAMMING THE CORTICOSTEROID TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATORY NETWORK", "id is /awards/UM1HG009435/, type are Award, Item, description is Project Summary The ENCODE project has generated comprehensive maps of cis-regulatory elements (CREs) controlling the transcription of genes within the human genome. These maps have been crucial in our efforts to understand sequence variants linked to human traits and disease, as the majority of these variants are non- coding regulatory changes rather than amino acid substitutions. However, even though we know the locations of thousands of CREs, our understanding of how they operate is derived from a relatively small set of well- described examples. Therefore, we plan to directly characterize the function of ENCODE CREs at a genome- wide scale in multiple cell-types. This will transition the field of functional genomics from a simple map of regulatory elements towards a deep understanding of the fundamental rules governing regulatory logic down to the basepair resolution. Achieving this will dramatically expand ENCODE's utility by strengthening our ability to interpret the effects of natural human variation on gene regulation. We propose to directly measure regulatory activity of over 3% of the genome, pursuing loci highlighted as important by ENCODE and other functional data. We will first apply computational methods to identify the most biologically informative CREs, representing a diversity of regulatory logic and architecture, and will use machine learning techniques to prioritize functional variants for characterization relevant to common and rare human diseases, traits, and adaptation. Of these we will select 200,000 CREs and 300,000 variants, representing 100 Mb of genomic sequence, and characterize them using the massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to understand each element's regulatory activity. Then, to complement data from the MPRA, we will characterize additional 1 Mb regions across 10 loci using CRISPR-based non-coding screens to build a comprehensive picture of these loci. This strategy leverages the throughput and flexibility of MPRA while maintaining the connectivity of regulatory logic in the CRISPR-based screens, which perturb elements within their endogenous genomic context. This will help us judge the accuracy and completeness of ENCODE, while also providing data from both approaches to address a wide-variety of research questions. These methods are difficult to apply to disease relevant primary cells at full scale, but we will use the results of our MPRA and CRISPR screens to inform our models and better predict the fundamental rules of regulatory logic. We will then construct smaller, targeted libraries to test disease-specific variants in primary cells and use assays specific for each of three autoimmune diseases: type 1 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and lupus. This approach will inform the research community on the rules governing the activity of the CREs mapped by the ENCODE project, and will simultaneously provide concrete information about the function of hundreds of thousands of sequence variants relevant for human traits, health, and disease., pi  title is Pardis Sabeti, rfa is ENCODE4, title is COMPREHENSIVE FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION AND DISSECTION OF NONCODING REGULATORY ELEMENTS AND HUMAN GENETIC VARIATION", "id is /awards/R01GM037706/, type are Award, Item, description is We propose to continue a multidisciplinary project to understand the mechanisms by which aberrant, unusual, or foreign RNA and DNA structures trigger gene silencing. The major aims of this project are: 1. Establish the mechanisms by which miRNA, siRNA, and piRNA effectors repress their genetic targets. Thirty years of careful molecular-genetic analysis of developmental progression in C. elegans, combined with new technologies for genome editing, provide a remarkable ability to make targeted changes \"in place\" in genomic contexts that will allow us to address specific physiological regulatory mechanisms in vivo. Adding the intensive genetic analysis of small RNA targeting machineries that has been performed in C. elegans yields a platform to definitively assign silencing mechanisms for each of the major small RNA regulatory classes. Assigning these mechanisms should provide important guidance in understanding small RNA-based effects on physiology and disease and in applying small RNAs as modulators in experimental and therapeutic contexts. 2. Investigate mechanisms used by organisms to recognize and silence foreign DNA. Along with an ability to recognize and target foreign or aberrant RNA, cells have sets of mechanisms to recognize and silence foreign DNA molecules introduced by injection or other routes. In some aspects, such mechanisms overlap with known foreign RNA defense mechanisms, while certain features of the foreign DNA response are not easily explained by current RNA-based silencing models. We will analyze a set of non-cannonical triggering events and downstream silencing processes with the long term goals of understanding DNA-triggered silencing mechanisms, being able to defeat these mechanisms for specific experimental or therapeutic goals that involve expression of foreign DNA, and of being able to co-opt DNA silencing as needed to flexibly block specific gene expression. 3. Investigate the mechanisms by which new small RNA effector repertoire is acquired by the genome. Genomic regions encoding small RNA effectors show a remarkably dynamic character, allowing acquisition of new silencing capabilities and thus protection against novel invasive agents as appropriate specificities are added to the repertoire. Little is known about how new small RNA repertoire is added, with recent technical advances in sequence analysis allowing these questions to be addressed both on a structural level (what structures give rise to new elements of the repertoire) and on a functional level (how new sequence acquisitions are executed). Understanding of RNA repertoire acquisition will be of considerable value, (i) in guiding our views on the role and capabilities dynamic small RNA regulatory systems, (ii) in illuminating any conditions resulting from inability to adapt and thus respond to novel pathogens, and (iii) in providing a potential entry into using the system for directed repertoire expansion to provide experimental or therapeutic intervention., pi  title is Andrew Fire, rfa is community, title is GENE REGULATION DURING EARLY DEVELOPMENT C.ELEGANS", "id is /awards/U01HG004571/, type are Award, Item, description is Our understanding of post-transcriptional regulation is comparatively poor, with only a handful of regulatory elements that direct post-transcriptional control being experimentally characterized. Eukaryotic organisms depend on the actions of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) for successful post-transcriptional control gene expression and they provide the link between transcriptional and translational regulation, playing essential roles in many regulatory processes including transcription, splicing, export, stability and translation. The comprehensive identification of cis-regulatory elements residing in expressed RNA is fundamental to the NIH/NHGRI ENCODE project but is extremely limited at the present time. Previously we developed methods for purifying endogenous RBP-RNA complexes and identifying the associated RNA targets using whole genome expression array technologies (termed ribonomics). This advance enabled the large-scale identification of many mRNA targets of RBPs and provided new insight into the principles governing posttranscriptional gene regulation. Our studies demonstrated that, analogous to transcriptional regulation, groups of functionally related RNAs are coordinately regulated in a combinatorial manner by distinct classes of RBPs by targeting related cis-regulatory elements located in the transcripts. As part of an earlier ENCODE technology grant, we improved our technology by developing a RIP-Chip tiling-array based assay that incorporates a digestion step to facilitate the identification of targeted cis-regulatory elements/RBPbinding sites. Using this method, the objective of this project is to comprehensively catalog the cis regulatory elements/RBP-binding sites CREBS present in expressed ENCODE mRNA using the five ENCODE cell lines and several cellular perturbations. This will be accomplished by (1) characterizing the genome-wide associations of expressed mRNA with a set of representative set of RBPs using ribonomic profiling and whole-genome expression arrays; (2) identifying the CREBS of the subset of ENCODE expressed mRNAs using tiling-array based RIP-Chip; (3) verifying and further increasing the resolution of predicted ENCODE cis-regulatory elements/RBP-binding sites using bioinformatics followed by quantitative Real-Time PCR and (4) biologically validating the function and RBP-binding activity of identified CREBS using a reporter assay. ln summary, we will use RNA-binding proteins to identify RNA based cis-regulatory elements / RBP-binding sites in the ENCODE sequence of the human genome., pi  title is Scott Tenenbaum, rfa is ENCODE2, title is COMPREHENSIVE IDENTIFICATION OF ENCODE RNA BASED CIS-REGULATORY ELEMENTS", "id is /awards/GM046883/, type are Award, Item, description is Epigenetic modifications modulate gene expression in normal development and in diseases, such as cancer. X chromosome regulation is an example of coordinate epigenetic regulation of gene expression at the level of an entire chromosome. Our goal is to investigate the epigenetic regulation of X-linked genes in mammals. Genes on the X chromosome are dosage compensated by two processes: upregulation of the active X chromosome in both sexes, and X inactivation in females. A subset of genes escapes X inactivation and thus has higher expression in females. The importance of these genes in normal development is illustrated by the phenotypic anomalies including embryonic lethality in Turner syndrome, which is associated with a single X chromosome. We will investigate the molecular mechanisms that allow genes that escape X inactivation to be expressed within the context of silenced chromatin., pi  title is Christine Disteche, rfa is community, title is MOUSE X INACTIVATION", "id is /awards/U01ES017155/, type are Award, Item, description is The Reference Epigenome Mapping Centers (REMC) will aim to transform our understanding of human epigenetics through production and integrative analysis of comprehensive reference epigenomes for ES cells, differentiated cells and tissues. In pursuit of this goal, we have assembled a unique scientific team and infrastructure with broad expertise and capabilities in stem cell biology, epigenomics, technology, production research and computation. We recently demonstrated two complementary methods that leverage ultra high-throughput sequencing for epigenomic analysis. In the first method, genome-wide chromatin maps are acquired by deep sequencing chromatin IP DNA (ChlP-Seq). In the second, nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps are generated by high-throughput bisulfite-sequencing (HTBS). These methods represent major improvements over prior tools as they yield precise digital information, have high genome coverage, require fewer cells and are cost-effective. Multiple epigenomic maps have already been produced for stem cells and primary tissues, and pipelines have been assembled for efficient data collection, processing and analysis. For the REMC project, we propose to apply ChlP-Seq and HTBS pipelines to generate comprehensive high-resolution maps of chromatin state and DNA methylation for 100 diverse cell types. Cell types were selected for their biological and medical importance, and for their potential to maximize the comprehensiveness of acquired epigenomic data. They include human ES cells, ES-derived cells, mesenchymal stem cells, reprogrammed stem cells and primary tissues. ChlP-Seq will be used to map highly informative chromatin modifications and related chromatin proteins in each cell type. HTBS will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps. Reference epigenomes will reveal the locations and activation states of diverse functional genomic elements, inform on the developmental state and potential of studied cell populations, and provide a framework for understanding complex epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. All data will be made available to the scientific community upon verification. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Comprehensive characterization of epigenetic marks ('the epigenome') is a critical step towards a global understanding of the human genome in health and disease. The proposed mapping studies will provide unprecedented views of the human epigenetic landscape and its variation across cell states, offer fundamental insight into the functions and interrelationships of epigenetic marks, and provide a framework for future studies of normal and diseased epigenomes., pi  title is Bradley Bernstein, rfa is Roadmap, title is PRODUCTION SEQUENCING OF REFERENCE HUMAN EPIGENOMES", "id is /awards/P50HG007735/, type are Award, Item, description is DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the rapidly increasing capacity to sequence human genomes, our incomplete ability to read and interpret the information content in genomes and epigenomes remain a central challenge. A comprehensive set of regulatory events across a genome - the regulome - is needed to make full use of genomic information, but is currently out of reach for practically all clinical applications and many biological systems The proposed Center will develop technologies that greatly increase the sensitivity, speed, and comprehensiveness of understanding genome regulation. We will develop new technologies to interrogate the transactions between the genome and regulatory factors, such as proteins and noncoding RNAs, and integrate variations in DNA sequences and chromatin states over time and across individuals. Novel molecular engineering and biosensor strategies are deployed to encapsulate the desired complex DNA transformations into the probe system, such that the probe system can be directly used on very small human clinical samples and capture genome-wide information in one or two steps. These technologies will be applied to clinical samples and workflows in real time to exercise their robustness and reveal for the first time epigenomic dynamics of human diseases during progression and treatment. These technologies will be broadly applicable to many biomedical investigations, and the Center will disseminate the technologies via training and diverse means., pi  title is Alexander Urban, rfa is community, title is CENTER FOR PERSONAL DYNAMIC REGULOMES - PROJECT 4", "id is /awards/U01HG003161/, type are Award, Item, description is The overall aim of this research proposal is to apply functional methodology (initially developed at UW and adapted to high throughput by Regulome Corporation) for quantitative chromatin profiling to delineate the functional DNA elements across 30 megabases of human genome sequence selected by the ENCODE working group (the 'ENCODE regions'). First we will produce a quantitative chromatin profile of the ENCODE regions in a human lymphoblastoid cell line. This profile will enable precise localization of all major Dnasel-hypersensitive sites ('HSs' hereafter). Quantification of sequence-specific Dnasel sensitivity will be accomplished through application of a novel, tested high-throughput quantitative real-time PCR assay ('Hypersensitivity qPCR' or 'HSqPCR'). A specialized primer set that spans the ENCODE regions at high resolution will be designed and synthesized. This primer set will be employed in all the experiments. Second, we will produce quantitative chromatin profiles of the ENCODE regions in 3 additional cell types derived from the 3 major embryonic lineages (endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm). These profiles will enable localization of all major HSs present in each tissue type. The profiles, in combination with that of lymphoid cells, will further enable identification of tissue or lineage-restricted HSs and also of sites present in multiple lineages. Third, we will perform confirmatory validation experiments on identified HSs using high-resolution hypersensitivity Southerns. Hypersensitivity Southerns represent an extensively applied 'gold-standard' methodology for identification of HSs. 250 sites per year will be selected from those identified with the high throughput method and validated with this independent methodology. Fourth, the quantitative chromatin profiles produced will be subjected to detailed computational analysis with the aim of determining the correspondence between HSs and evolutionarily-conserved non-coding sequences. Parallel analyses will focus on identification of DNA sequence motifs associated with tissue-specific, lineage-specific, or multilineage HSs. Algorithms for identification and classification of HSs in the human genome will be developed and tested. The performance of selected published algorithms for identification of active regulatory sequences will also be evaluated. It is expected that this research effort will result in the identification of the majority (if not all) of the regulatory elements of the ENCODE regions, and will provide information on the feasibility of the application of this functional approach to the identification of all regulatory elements of the human genome., pi  title is George Stamatoyannopoulos, rfa is ENCODE, title is IDENTIFICATION OF FUNCTIONAL DNA ELEMENTS BY HSQPCR", "id is /awards/UM1HG009428/, type are Award, Item, description is There is a fundamental gap in understanding how the millions of known regulatory elements functionally contribute to gene regulation and phenotypes. Continued existence of that gap is an important problem because, until it is filled, it will remain extremely difficult to identify the genetic mechanisms underlying the thousands of observed genetic associations with disease phenotypes. Our long-term goal is to understand how and to what extent gene regulatory elements alter target gene expression and impact phenotypes. The objectives of this particular proposal are to functionally characterize all regulatory elements contributing to the differentiation of CD4+ T cells. In doing so, we will identify the causal regulatory mechanisms that modulate the immune system. The rationale for this work is that understanding those mechanisms will be the foundation for future efforts to therapeutically modulate the immune system, and will establish a discovery platform for determining the mechanisms underlying countless other model systems. Specifically, we will characterize three complementary components of regulatory element activity: (i) the capacity of regulatory elements to drive expression of a reporter gene, (ii) the effect of each regulatory element on the expression of one or more target genes, and (iii) the contributions of regulatory elements to phenotypic function, namely differentiation. We will accomplish those goals across three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will quantify the activity of all regulatory elements that have evidence of differential activity between subtypes of mouse CD4 T cells. We will do so using a capture-based high-throughput reporter assay that allows us to assay larger (>500 bp) fragments from specific genomic regions of interest. In Aim 2, we will quantify the effects of regulatory elements on target genes using a novel strategy that combines high-throughput CRISPR/ Cas9-based epigenome editing screens and targeted high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing. In Aim 3, we will determine which regulatory elements are necessary or sufficient for CD4 T cell differentiation using high-throughput CRISPR/Cas9-based epigenome-editing screens combined differentiation into particular CD4 T cell subtypes. Each aim will provide functional characterization of all of the regulatory elements implicated in CD4 T cell differentiation. Together, the aims will provide a comprehensive, multi-layered, and systematic understanding of the ways that gene regulatory elements modulate the immune system. The result will be an actionable set of targets for designing strategies to modulate immune system activity for therapeutic benefit. Because the approach is general to any model system, the same strategy can be readily transferred to diverse systems including differentiation and disease models. Therefore, we expect that this project will have both immediate and long-term benefit for determining the ways that regulatory elements contribute to health and disease., pi  title is Tim Reddy, rfa is ENCODE4, title is REGULATORY MECHANISMS OF CD4+ T CELL DIFFERENTIATION", "id is /awards/U41HG007355/, type are Award, Item, description is Our project seeks to identify the regulatory elements recognized by the vast majority of transcription factors (TFs) in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. In the initial modENCODE project, an experimental pipeline was developed and applied to -100 TFs in each organism. In this intervening year, we expect to capture data for another 75-100 factors. The present project builds on the advances made by the groups in the initial phase and also combines the production pipelines to increase efficiency and to realize economies of scale. With these improvements, we will generate data sets for another 400 factors from each organism, which when combined with previous work will represent the bulk of all transcription factors in these key model organisms. For both organisms, the overall strategy tags transcription factor genes by fusion with an enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (eGFP) sequence through recombineering of large insert clones, and introducing the tagged genes into the genome by transgenesis. ChlP-seq using a high quality anti-GFP antibody is performed on the developmental stage(s) with maximal GFP expression, as guided by available RNA-seq expression data. The aligned sequence reads are analyzed to identify candidate binding sites and likely target genes. We will prioritize TFs with human homologs to maximize the broader utility of the data. We will also perform RNAi of 125 TFs in each organism, followed by RNA-seq, to validate called peaks and their assigned target genes. Finally, we will integrate the information for the different data setsto construct regulatory networks implied by the TF binding site data. We will coordinate with ENCODE projects on human TFs, and our data will provide key in vivo and developmental regulatory information that will be essential to delineate both fundamentally conserved as well as human-specific properties of TFs. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Insights from the study of the model organisms Drosophila and C. elegans provide the basis for broad understanding of fundamental processes of animal biology. Because many of their genes have clear relatives in humans, these studies have also led directly to improved understanding of human diseases and in some cases to therapies. Similarly, creating a comprehensive understanding of transcription factor binding sites and building regulatory networks in these key model organisms will create the foundation for understanding human regulatory networks both in health and disease., pi  title is Robert Waterston, rfa is modERN, title is CREATING COMPREHENSIVE MAPS OF WORM AND FLY TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR BINDING SITES", "id is /awards/UM1HG009411/, type are Award, Item, description is Almost a tenth of human genes code for proteins that interact with chromosomes in the nucleus. Most of these DNA-associated proteins (referred to as DAPs) are involved in regulating the expression of genes, by serving as part of the basic transcriptional machinery, as transcription factors that regulate the spatial and temporal levels of transcription, or as chromatin state regulators. These proteins are key components in biology, as transcriptional regulation underlies fundamental biological processes in organismal development, in determining cell states during differentiation, and in directing physiological responses to the internal and external environment. Thus, comprehensive and detailed assessment of the molecular actions of DAPs, that is, where they interact throughout the human genome, is a fundamental long-term goal of both basic and clinical research. In response to RFA-HG-16-002, \u201cExpanding the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) in the Human and Mouse (UM1)\u201d, this application proposes to use a recently-established \"shovel ready\" pipeline for mapping DAPs in human cell lines that overcomes the very high failure rates of traditional ChIP-seq, a widely- used approach that requires specific antibodies for each factor. The new approach, called CETCh-seq, involves adding an epitope tag at the endogenous locus encoding each protein, and using chromatin immunoprecipitation with a universal antibody against the epitope followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify DAP-DNA associations genome-wide. This production pipeline will be applied to each of 1,244 DAPs that are expressed in a set of human cell lines and have not yet been mapped by ENCODE. During the four-year project, this pipeline will be used to test each of these factors in one human cell line, and for 100 of the DAPs, in four human cell lines, allowing characterization of cell-type differences. The project will also tag and assay multiple allelic versions of a small number of DAPs in which pathogenic or potentially pathogenic mutations have been identified. The project will produce genome-wide DAP maps and identify motifs for hundreds of human regulatory proteins, providing an important component for the next phase of the ENCODE Project. All data, as well as useful materials in the form of gene editing plasmids and tagged human cell lines, will be made freely available to the research community., pi  title is Richard Myers, rfa is ENCODE4, title is AN ENCODE CHIP-SEQ PIPELINE USING ENDOGENOUSLY TAGGED HUMAN DNA-ASSOCIATED PROTEINS", "id is /awards/U24HG009446/, type are Award, Item, description is The goal of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project is to catalog all functional elements in the human genome through the integration and analysis of high-throughput data. We propose to continue the ENCODE Data Analysis Center (EDAC, DAC) which will provide support and leadership in analyzing and integrating data from the ENCODE project as well as work closely with other ENCODE groups including the Data Coordination Center. Our proposed DAC team (Zhiping Weng, Mark Gerstein, Manolis Kellis, Roderic Guigo, Rafael Irizarry, X. Shirley Liu, Anshul Kundaje, and William Noble) has expertise across a wide range of fields including transcriptional regulation, epigenetics, evolution, genomics and proteomics, regulatory RNA, biophysics, and computational biology, where they are the leaders in machine learning, statistical genetics, networks, and gene annotation. These investigators also have a history of successfully working collaboratively in large consortia, particularly with other ENCODE groups. Their publication records demonstrate their synergistic approach to producing high-impact science and useful resources that benefit the broader biomedical communities. The proposed DAC will pursue the following four aims: Aim 1. Analyze and integrate data and metadata from a broad range of functional genomics projects; Aim 2. Serve as an informatics resource by supporting the activities of the ENCODE Analysis Working Group; Aim 3. Create high-quality Encyclopedias of DNA elements in the human and mouse genomes; Aim 4. Assess quality and utility of the ENCODE data and provide feedback to NHGRI and the Consortium., pi  title is Zhiping Weng, rfa is ENCODE4, title is EDAC: ENCODE DATA ANALYSIS CENTER", "id is /awards/U01HG007919/, type are Award, Item, description is The modeling of transcription to genome proximal elements to date has revealed associations, but seldom are disruptions performed to confirm mechanistic possibilities and substantiate causality. In studying multistate cell systems, many processes important to human health are difficult to study due to low cell availability and/or dyssynchrony leading to heterogeneous cell populations. We propose to study a model of the human epidermal differentiation system, which by its intrinsic properties does not have these problems but at the same time closely simulates the native process. We plan to perform multiple next generation sequencing modalities of transcription and gene proximal components over a time course spanning the transition from progenitor to differentiated keratinocytes. A network based on boosting methods and dynamic Bayesian networks will then be generated to model transcription to the gene proximal components, and this construct will be tested with various regulatory disruptions. Moreover, additional assays of transcription and gene proximal components will be performed during intervals which the model suggests will be particularly illuminating for epidermal differentiation. With these new data, the model will be further refined, and this cycle will be repeated multiple times. Because of the tractability of our experimental system to a vast array of sequencing assays and regulatory disruptions, we will be able to achieve an understanding of how much each assay contributes to the predictive accuracy of our model. In this way, our results will have implications not only for skin biology and hundreds of skin disorders but also for network modeling of transcriptional regulation in general., pi  title is Michael Snyder, rfa is GGR, title is GENOMICS OF GENE REGULATION IN PROGENITOR TO DIFFERENTIATED KERATINOCYTES", "id is /awards/UM1HG009421/, type are Award, Item, description is We propose to establish a Center for In Vivo Characterization of ENCODE Elements (CIViC) as part of ENCODE Phase 4. Understanding the function of the 98% of the human genome that is noncoding remains one of the most pressing challenges in genomics. The ENCODE Program has enabled major progress toward obtaining genome-wide molecular signatures associated with the human and mouse genome. During ENCODE3 our group contributed to the mapping of enhancer-associated marks, DNA methylation, and transcriptomes from multiple mouse tissues across closely spaced time points of embryogenesis, resulting in >750 datasets defining the in vivo epigenomic landscape during mammalian development. Our group has also characterized over 3,000 candidate enhancer sequences in transgenic mouse assays, including more than 400 through our participation in ENCODE2 and ENCODE3. Despite this progress, enhancers are only one of many noncoding molecular functions that have been inferred from ENCODE data. Other major proposed categories of noncoding sequences identified through ENCODE and other publicly available data sets include DNA elements with predicted functions, such as \u201csuper-enhancers\u201d (very large enhancers with possibly distinct functions) or chromatin domain boundary elements. They also include sequence classes of unknown function primarily defined by specific assays, such as differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The functional impact of these different classes of noncoding sequences on organismal biology and human health remains minimally explored, representing a major limitation of the ENCODE encyclopedia. The Center for In Vivo Characterization of ENCODE Elements will use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to systematically explore the biological significance of several classes of noncoding function based on ENCODE3 data. Leveraging the streamlined set of mouse engineering tools available in our laboratory, we will: 1. Perform integrative analysis of ENCODE3 and complementary data sets to identify and prioritize representative sequences from 3 different classes of noncoding elements (enhancers and super-enhancers, boundary elements, DMRs); 2. Systematically delete a total of 48 representative sequences in mice and perform RNA-seq and gross organismal phenotyping to understand the in vivo consequences of these deletions; 3. Continue to make transgenic enhancer characterization capabilities available to ENCODE investigators to validate and calibrate enhancer prediction methods. We will also use transgenics and CRISPR knock-in editing to test human disease-associated alleles of ENCODE-predicted enhancer elements. All efforts will be closely coordinated with other ENCODE4 functional characterization groups to focus on common sets of elements to be characterized using the full ENCODE-wide arsenal of in vitro and in vivo characterization methods. Our results will provide an understanding of the in vivo significance of different classes of noncoding elements and thereby substantially increase the value of the ENCODE encyclopedia., pi  title is Len Pennacchio, rfa is ENCODE4, title is IN VIVO CHARACTERIZATION OF MAJOR ENCODE-PREDICTED CLASSES OF NONCODING ELEMENTS", "id is /awards/GM131745/, type are Award, Item, description is Mammalian X chromosome inactivation is a complex epigenetic mechanism that ensures a near-balanced level of gene expression between males (XY) and females (XX). This chromosome-wide regulation makes the X an ideal model for studying heterochromatin regulation and structure. X inactivation affects a sizable portion of the mammalian genome and is crucial for normal development and normal lifespan. Indeed, X aberrations have been linked to birth defects and to age-related diseases. My research group has made several contributions to understanding the structure and regulation of the X by developing useful mouse models and studying human conditions with sex chromosome anomalies, while embracing novel technologies to advance the field. Here, I consider challenges related to the physical structure and location of the inactive X within the nucleus, with a focus on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). By scaffolding proteins into flexible complexes lncRNAs have emerged as adaptable elements that organize chromatin and regulate gene expression, but many questions remain unanswered about their mechanisms of action. I will examine the cis- and trans- roles of conserved X-linked lncRNA loci and their transcripts in regulating the structure and location of the X chromosome within the nucleus. We found that Dxz4 shapes the unique bipartite structure of the inactive X in cis and Firre apparently controls the inactive X location and epigenetic features in trans. Here, I propose to introduce new approaches to manipulate these and other lncRNA loci and to relocate specific X chromosome regions within the nucleus. This will address the fundamental role of physical location in relation to heterochromatin formation and maintenance. Escape from X inactivation in females and the presence of a Y in males lead to sexual dimorphisms in cell physiology. Cell-type diversity within tissues is extensive but poorly understood; yet, novel exciting new technologies can measure gene expression and chromatin features in tens of thousands of single cells in vivo. To address the role of sex-linked genes at the cellular and organismal level I will establish an in vivo atlas of allelic features in single cells of male and female mouse tissues. Single-cell technology will also be applied to mouse and human tissues from fetuses and adults with sex chromosome aneuploidy to determine the impact on cell types. An interesting possibility is that an adaptive developmental epigenetic response to aneuploidy explains phenotypic variability. To explore this, I will compare epigenetic features in tissues to those obtained in isogenic cell lines with induced X chromosome loss. My goal is to understand the role of the sex chromosomes in sex differences and sex chromosome disorders in vivo., pi  title is Christine Disteche, rfa is community, title is X CHROMOSOME REGULATION AND ROLE IN ANEUPLOIDY", "id is /awards/UM1HG009436/, type are Award, Item, description is The ENCODE project has produced high-resolution, high-quality maps of components of the `regulome' in a set of tissues and cell lines, identifying a collection of putative regulatory elements. Our proposal aims to test the functional relevance of these putative elements with high-throughput, pooled CRISPR screens. This powerful platform will allow us to up-regulate, down-regulate, or mutate specific regulatory elements, and then probe the effects of these perturbations on cell survival under normal growth conditions, and a variety of stress conditions (oxidative stress, ricin toxicity, and nutrient deprivation) that produce differential sensitivities to gene expression. To establish our targets, we will use ENCODE data in concert with other consortia-generated data using an integrative analysis pipeline that leverages both correlation between element activity and gene expression, and higher order chromatin interactions to link functional elements with potential target genes. For ~3000 genes for which we have observed that perturbation affects proliferation, we will generate multiple libraries of ~100,000 guide RNAs for redundantly perturbing 20,000 enhancers linked to these genes through our analysis. After identifying \u201chits\u201d in this screen by sequencing the guide RNA libraries before and after proliferation under our test conditions to observe a reduction in specific guides, we will also test combinations of enhancer elements that may act in a cooperative or redundant fashion, exploring the functional linkages with a specific focus on superenhancers and their sub-elements. With these phenotypic validation data in hand, we will carry out molecular mechanistic validation by choosing 100 individual elements, and 50 combinations of elements to generate stable cell lines with engineered genetic ablation of elements, and carry out genome- wide molecular characterization of accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq), chromatin looping (HiChIA, a novel, high- efficiency chromatin looping assay), and gene expression (RNA-seq). We will also generate and assess 50 lines ablating entire superenhancers and individual superenhancer elements \u2013 both individually in in combination. For a subset of these lines, we will carry out single cell ATAC-seq to unravel effects on variations of open chromatin within the population of cells. We will also compare results from pooled CRISPR expression reporter assays to our method of generating edits in the native genomic context. Analyzing these data using powerful, integrative analysis methods, scaffolded from ENCODE data, will generate global maps of the molecular consequences of deletions at the level of chromatin and gene expression changes. These data will be rapidly released to the community, and all techniques and cell lines will be made available to the ENCODE consortium and to the genomics community at large. This project will deliver an immense corpus of functional data linking regulatory elements to genes, as well as extensive molecular characterization of a subset of these regulatory elements, providing a scaffold for understanding classes and logic of functional elements, validating computational predictions, and providing techniques that broadly extensible to other cell types and tissues., pi  title is Will Greenleaf, rfa is ENCODE4, title is HIGH-THROUGHPUT SYSTEMATIC CHARACTERIZATION OF REGULATORY ELEMENT FUNCTION", "id is /awards/U01HG007912/, type are Award, Item, description is The expression of genes involves a sequence of enzymatic events, such as transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation, that are subject to gene regulatory networks (GRNs) of protein-nucleic acid interactions. It is well appreciated that the control of transcription via regulatory networks that regulate enhancer and promoter activities are not the sole determinant of what gene products result, but that exon skipping is pervasive and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as mRNA splicing and decay determine the kinetics of mRNA induction and abundance. Indeed, in our preliminary studies of the macrophage response to pathogens, we find that a majority of induced gene expression events result in mRNAs that deviate substantially from those predicted by the genome-browser, and that mRNA decay is controlled by both protein- nucleic acid and miRNA regulatory networks. The proposed Center for the \"Ribonomics\" of Gene Regulation leverages and pioneers Next Gen Sequencing and computational modeling approaches to develop a predictive model for which mRNA isoforms are expressed and at what level given a given promoter activity and transcription initiation rate. We will develop generally applicable tools in conjunction with or in depth and quantitative experimental analysis of the macrophage response to pathogen-associated endotoxin, which results in the dramatic up regulation of more than 1000 genes. Strikingly, our preliminary data identified more than 900 exon skipping events in addition to numerous cases of alternative 5' or 3' splice site use, emphasizing the essential contribution of post-initiation events. Further, these splice patterns are dependent on the macrophage subtype-specific chromatin landscape and are altered by inducible splice factors in primed or tolerated states. Thus we will leverage the well-described macrophage biology and associated experimental model systems, to examine the role of gene structure and sequence (Aim 1), the role of chromatin modifications (Aim 2), and of trans-acting splicing factors (Aim 3) in determining the identity of mature mRNAs and their associated synthesis rates, before adding the stimulus-responsive regulatory networks that confer mRNA half-life control and thus determine the abundance of each mRNA isoform (Aim 4)., pi  title is Alexander Hoffmann, rfa is GGR, title is RIBONOMICS OF GENE REGULATION TO PREDICT INNATE IMMUNE RESPONSES", "id is /awards/3UM1HG009409-04S1/, type are Award, Item, description is Efforts to map the functional elements of the human genome, which include elements such as insulators, enhancers, promoters and transcriptional start sites, have historically treated the genome as linear. However, it is now well appreciated that the genome has a three-dimensional (3D) organization that is important for mediating functional associations between regulatory elements and gene-coding sequences. Thus a linear map provides an incomplete picture of the genome, and it is often difficult or impossible to infer functional associations between regulatory elements without a topological framework to provide context. We have developed and advanced a powerful, high-resolution method for providing such a topological framework, Chromatin Interaction Analysis using Paired-End Tag sequencing (ChIA-PET). Using ChIA-PET, we have demonstrated that specific DNA motifs bound by CCTC-binding Factor (CTCF) are critical in defining topological domains and arranging the gene positions for coordinated transcription mediated by RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII). Therefore, the combination of CTCF and RNAPII ChIA-PET will be effective for comprehensively mapping the major structure codes and topological organization that scaffold RNAPII associated transcriptional regulation. We will contribute ChIA-PET technology to the ENCODE Project to both strengthen existing ENCODE datasets and identify new \u201cstructure code\u201d elements and their interplays with gene-coding sequences that will aid in understanding the transcriptional landscape of the genome. We have established a robust ChIA-PET pipeline from library production to data processing for human and mouse cells. Here, we propose to apply this platform to assay large numbers of cell lines and primary cells that represent a wide-range of cellular space with important biological significance. Based on our current production scale and estimated budget allocation, we aim to produce 1024 high quality datasets from CTCF and RNAPII ChIA-PET experiments, each with two biological replicates for 256 biological samples. This pipeline capacity will be applied to samples selected by the ENCODE Consortium, and to this sample pool we aim to contribute a collection of high value biological samples that are likely of common interest to both the Consortium and the greater research community. These samples include both primary and in vitro\u2013differentiated human blood cells, healthy and diseased induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), mature neurons differentiated from the iPSCs, and several major cell and tissue types from healthy and disease-model mice. These samples were selected to expand the \u201ccell space\u201d explored by the ENCODE Project and also because ChIA-PET analyses will be particularly relevant for revealing fundamental biology., pi  title is Charles Lee, rfa is ENCODE4, title is 3UM1HG009409-04S1", "id is /awards/U01HG009431/, type are Award, Item, description is While accurate annotations of protein-coding regions in the human genome have been available for many years, annotation and interpretation of regulatory sequences has lagged far behind. This is because\u2014in contrast to protein-coding sequences\u2014the \u201crules\u201d that govern links from genome sequence to regulatory function are fuzzy, complex, and highly context-specific. Our limited understanding of regulatory regions presents a fundamental challenge for the identification and interpretation of disease variation, especially in the context of personal genome interpretation. Work from ENCODE and other groups has started to close this gap through experimental work, including high-resolution maps of regulatory sites in a variety of cell types, and modeling of the cell-type specific mappings from genome sequence to regulatory function. In this project we will develop a suite of new tools that uses these diverse new data sets to tackle these problems. We will implement and apply powerful new machine learning methods (based on deep learning) to interpret the genomic, context-specific encoding of regulatory information, and to identify genetic variants that impact the encoded information. We will build models using data from a variety of sources including ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, GTEx, regulatory variation in the HapMap cell lines, as well as from disease cohorts. Validation experiments will be performed using a new high-complexity CRISPR/Cas9 system developed by our team. We will develop software tools and analytical results that can be widely used for genome interpretation, especially in analysis of personal genomes. By the end of this study we expect to have: (1) developed powerful new computational models for predicting regulatory function in a wide variety of cell types, at unprecedented resolution; (2) implemented novel validation screens in native chromatin at extremely high throughput; and (3) developed new tools for interpreting common and rare regulatory variation, with particular focus on identification of high-impact regulatory mutations in personal genomes.

Differential use of regulatory elements defines most previously studied lineage specific gene expression programs. However, challenges such as stress, injury, or infection can elicit adaptive or pathogenic responses in differentiated cells leading to a change in their functional state and transcriptional output. Cells of the immune system offer a powerful experimental model for dissection of genomic mechanisms underlying establishment of distinct differentiation and activation states. In this proposal, we study distinct CD4+ T cell populations as they transition from \"na\u00bfve\" (or resting) to activated states with opposing function: effector T cells that promote - and activated regulatory T cells (Treg) that suppress - immune response and associated inflammation. Resting Treg cells emerge during differentiation as a stable lineage of T lymphocytes distinct from na\u00bfve CD4+ T cells. We will use sophisticated genetic mouse models to generate a short-term inflammatory disorder and investigate genomic features of activated Treg and T effector cells and their resting counterparts in an inflammatory context in vivo. We will profile the enhancer and transcriptional landscapes of the four cell states using DNase-seq, TF and histone modification ChIP-seq, and bulk and single-cell RNA-seq profiles from ex vivo isolated cells. Using these comprehensive data sets, we will: (1) decode the changes in the enhancer landscape that govern the activation of distinct CD4+ T lymphocyte populations; (2) model the differential transcriptional output of genes in these cells as a function of the sequence and activity of their enhancers; and (3) model the expression distribution of individual genes over a population of cells as a function of the state space of their enhancers. Given the central role that Treg cells play in suppressing immune-mediated inflammation in diverse biological contexts ranging from autoimmunity, injury, and infection to pregnancy and metabolic disease as well as emerging understanding of their pivotal role in cancer, our study has broad relevance to human health and major practical significance., pi  title is Christina Leslie, rfa is GGR, title is DECODING IN VIVO REGULATORY PROGRAMS OF CD4+ T LYMPHOCYTE POPULATIONS IN INFLAMMA", "id is /awards/1U54DK107980/, type are Award, Item, description is The spatial organization of the genome impinges on all genomic processes, including gene regulation, maintenance of genome stability and chromosome transmission to daughter cells. A detailed understanding of the spatial arrangement of the human genome, referred to as the 4D nucleome, and the biological and physical principles that drive chromosome folding requires combining approaches from the fields of molecular and cell biology, imaging, genetics and genomics with approaches from physics, computational biology, and computer simulation. We have assembled a highly interdisciplinary center with the goal of generating extensively validated maps of the 4D nucleome, its physical and dynamic properties and its role in regulating the activity of the genome. First, the center will further optimize and extensively validate a suite of genome-wide molecular methodologies, based on chromosome conformation capture (3C) that can probe the folding of chromosomes at the scale of single nucleosomes, chromatin fibers, chromosomes and the entire nucleus, across cell populations and in single cells. Given that chromosome and nuclear organization is tightly linked to biological state of the cell, the center will map the 4D nucleome for four key biological states representing different conformations during the cell cycle (interphase and mitosis), and during cell differentiation (pluripotent and differentiated states). We will obtain complementary data regarding the structure and dynamics of chromatin, at different length scales and in single cells using extensive high-throughput imaging, live cell imaging and super resolution microscopy. Data obtained with all approaches will be analyzed, integrated and modeled using a set of methods we will further develop to gain insights into the structure, physics and dynamics of chromosome folding over different length scales. Finally, a critical component of our proposal is the biological validation and further elaboration of the chromatin interaction maps that are generated from our conformational analyses. This validation will be achieved through site-specific editing of genomic sequence and epigenetic marks, the creation of new contact points within the genome, and the identification of factors (both protein and nucleic acid) that facilitat or restrict these interactions.

We will use two very different biological models chosen for their high potential to act as generalizable exemplars for the study of enhancers in the context of (i) inherited risk factors for disease, and (ii) somatic mutations involved in cancers. We will also develop and refine our experimental methods in ENCODE cell lines, and we will reserve 25% of our efforts for testing candidate genomic elements that will be studied in common across all of the ENCODE Functional Characterization Centers. Using STARR-seq, and variations thereof, we will test for sufficiency of candidate enhancer elements to modulate gene expression. Using CRISPR-Cas9 methods we will edit the human genome, testing for necessity of candidate enhancer elements in their endogenous context. We will utilize these methods to examine the effects of inherited DNA variation on enhancer function in models of coronary artery disease (CAD), and to examine the effects of acquired somatic DNA mutations on enhancer function in models of pancreatic cancer (Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma \u2013 PDAC). While our approach necessarily requires a bioinformatics component to utilize ENCODE and other existing data sets in order to define the best candidate enhancer elements for testing in the specific biological models we will assay, our Center will be focused on experimental characterization of enhancers, testing different combinations of approaches in order to create extensible and generalizable protocols for systematic and accurate characterization of enhancer function., pi  title is Kevin White, rfa is ENCODE4, title is CENTER FOR FUNCTIONAL VALIDATION AND EVALUATION OF ENCODE ENHANCER REGIONS", "id is /awards/affiliates/, type are Award, Item, description is During ENCODE2, some labs that were not funded by the NIH donated data to the project., rfa is ENCODE2, title is ENCODE2 Affiliates", "id is /awards/U01HG009380/, type are Award, Item, description is While much progress has been made generating high quality chromatin state and accessibility data from the ENCODE and Roadmap consortia, accurately identifying cell-type specific enhancers from these data remains a significant challenge. We have recently developed a computational approach (gkmSVM) to predict regulatory elements from DNA sequence, and we have shown that when gkmSVM is trained on DHS data from each of the human and mouse ENCODE and Roadmap cells and tissues, it can predict both cell specific enhancer activity and the impact of regulatory variants (deltaSVM) with greater precision than alternative approaches. The gkmSVM model encapsulates a set of cell-type specific weights describing the regulatory binding site vocabulary controlling chromatin accessibility in each cell type. A striking observation is that the significant gkmSVM weights are generally identifiable with a small (~20) set of TF binding sites which vary by cell-type, consistent with the hypothesis that cell-type specific expression programs are controlled by a small set of core factors tightly coupled in mutually interacting regulatory circuits. Perturbations of these core regulators enable transitions between stable differentiated cell-type states of this genetic circuit. Here, we will use gkmSVM to systematically identify the core regulatory circuitry in all existing ENCODE and Roadmap human and mouse cell lines and tissues, and produce DNA sequence based genomic regulatory maps and fine-scale predictions of core regulator binding sites within predicted regulatory regions. We will generate binding site models for core regulators in each cell type, assess the accuracy of our predictions through direct experimental validation. The value of this map critically depends on its accuracy, so we demonstrate that gkmSVM predictions consistently outperform alternative methods in massively parallel enhancer reporter and luciferase validation assays, in blind community assessments of regulatory element predictions (CAGI), and in predicting validated causal disease associated variants. In contrast, we show that methods using PWM descriptions of TF binding sites are significantly less accurate. Finally, we will use our predictions of regulatory mutation impact to identify causal variants in GWAS and recently produced GTEx expression trait loci detected in a wide range of human tissues.

The ENCODE projects have revealed millions of putative regulatory elements across more than one hundred cell types and tissues. While these maps have significantly expanded our knowledge of non-coding sequences, there are still large gaps between having descriptive maps of functional elements and understanding the biology of these elements underlying gene regulation. These include: (a) few candidate functional elements predicted by the ENCODE experiments are functionally validated; (b) Epigenomic studies have not given/revealed information on the target genes of candidate functional elements. Therefore, it is still a challenge to interpret the biological functions of non-coding DNA sequences. To address these issues, the objective of this UM1 application is to perform large scale functional characterization of candidate functional elements in their native chromatin context. We will first identify candidate regulatory elements utilizing ENCODE data and generate reporter tagged genes of interest in cell lines utilizing a high throughput, automated platform. Second, we will interrogate candidate functional elements in their native chromatin contexts utilizing two complementary high throughput CRIPSR/Cas9 mediated genome editing approaches.

GENCODE aims for a better understanding of a `normal' human genome; using genome sequences of the most commonly used mouse strains will facilitate the most effective use of these key models for large-scale knockout analysis and disease-specific research. To produce regular annotation releases of high accuracy, GENCODE will continue to follow its well-established and conservative research design, supplemented by targeted investigations into the value of new technologies, new data and new sources of evidence. GENCODE focuses on protein-coding and non-coding loci, including their alternatively spliced isoforms and pseudogenes. Over the course of this proposal GENCODE will follow major directions in genomics, including graph- based genome representations, long-read transcriptome sequencing, connecting genes and the associated regulatory regions that affect their transcription, and identifying genes that are not present on the current reference assembly. The GENCODE consortium has four fundamental components: (1) a comprehensive gene annotation pipeline leveraging manual annotation; (2) an integrated approach to pseudogene identification and classification; (3) a set of computational methods to evaluate and enhance gene annotation; and (4) complementary experimental pipelines for validation and functional annotation. More specifically, in the next four years GENCODE aims to (1) extend the human and mouse GENCODE gene sets to as near completion as possible given current experimental technology; (2) deploy population-based genome annotation to ensure that any transcript isoform expressed in an individual human will be present in the reference annotation set; (3) extend the gene annotation to include core regulatory regions and tissue-specific enhancers from selected datasets; (4) to distribute GENCODE annotations and engage with community annotation efforts. Current popular distribution channels for GENCODE data including the GENCODE web site, the Ensembl and UCSC Genome Browsers, will be maintained. Finally, new mechanisms for prioritizing genes for manual annotation with community input will be established, with the long-term aim of establishing GENCODE as the standard annotation set for research and clinical genomics efforts., pi  title is Paul Flicek, rfa is community, title is GENCODE: COMPREHENSIVE GENOME ANNOTATION FOR HUMAN AND MOUSE", "id is /awards/R01HG009518/, type are Award, Item, description is Project Summary A comprehensive understanding of how genes' activities are controlled temporally and spatially is crucial for studying human development and diseases. Transcription factors (TFs) are an important class of regulatory proteins that can control genes' transcriptional activities by binding to target genes' regulatory DNA sequences called cis-regulatory elements (CREs). A map of genome-wide activities of CREs, or \u201cregulome\u201d, in all cell types and biological conditions will provide a foundation for investigating the basic operating rules of biology, interpreting how genetic variants cause diseases, and guiding the development of disease treatment strategies. Unfortunately, existing experimental regulome mapping technologies cannot analyze a large number of samples ef\ufb01ciently. Thus far, they have only been applied to map regulomes in a small fraction of all biological contexts. As a result, today a comprehensive map of human regulatory landscape is still lacking. This study aims to develop a solution to mapping regulomes in a massive number of biological samples from diverse cell types and conditions by leveraging publicly available functional genomic data. We will use the rich gene expression and regulome data generated by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project to develop a new prediction approach that predicts a biological sample's regulome using its transcriptome (Aim 1). We will then apply the trained prediction models to 290,000+ publicly available human gene expression samples in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to create a regulome map that covers hundreds of thousands more biological contexts than existing regulome data (Aim 2). We will also develop a method to help researchers explore the massive datasets to gain biological insights into gene regulation by projecting the data to their low- dimensional structure re\ufb02ecting their developmental trajectory (Aim 3). Our research will create new analytical methods for predicting ultra-high-dimensional outcomes using ultra- high-dimensional predictors, making cross-platform predictions when the training and application data are gener- ated by different technological platforms with systematic platform differences, and retrieving the low-dimensional spanning tree structure from a massive dataset. Applying these new methods to the vast amounts of publicly available gene expression data will allow us to address a major challenge in regulome mapping that cannot be solved using existing experimental technologies. By enabling fast and cost-ef\ufb01cient mapping and analysis of human gene regulatory landscape, the proposed research can have a major impact on future studies of human development and diseases., pi  title is Hongkai Ji, rfa is community, title is Big Data Methods for Decoding Gene Regulation", "id is /awards/Pew-00032016/, type are Award, Item, rfa is community, title is Pew Biomedical Scholars, Award Year 2018", "id is /awards/GM127671/, type are Award, Item, description is Gene expression is controlled by transcription factors that are often bound to chromatin hundreds of kilobases away. This long-range control of gene expression is accomplished through chromatin interactions as part of the 3D organization of the genome. Genome-wide studies of chromatin interactions (Hi-C) have identified several patterns of chromatin organization including compartments, topologically associated domains (TADs), and high intensity point-to-point loops. Fundamental principles causing the formation of these structures are not understood. For example, human cells form high intensity loops that are associated with CTCF and are dependent on its motifs orientation. A loop extrusion model has been proposed to explain this feature of mammalian CTCF motif orientation, but the mechanistic principle behind this phenomenon is unknown. I found that in Drosophila, CTCF does not form high intensity loops and the motif orientation does not correlate with any interaction preferences. Instead, non-CTCF loops occur in early development, but disappear in later stages when compartments and TADs appear. In C. elegans, which lacks CTCF altogether, high intensity loops correspond to dosage compensation complex recruitment sites. My preliminary work in analyzing C. elegans data indicates that a network of these loops spans the X chromosome. One major goal of this project is to discover fundamental principles of loop formation. Aim1 of this project will A) exploit the differences between CTCF looping in humans and Drosophila to determine how human CTCF loops form, B) explore the relationship of loops to TADs and compartments throughout development, and C) test whether or not loops create a network of interactions that contributes to the overall X chromosome structure and gene expression control in C. elegans. My previous work has indicated that transcription plays an important role in compartment and TAD formation, a feature that can be somewhat obscured by the prominent role of architectural proteins, like CTCF. Aim2 of this project will confirm the role of transcriptional elongation in chromatin organization and will decipher the individual roles of architectural proteins and transcriptional activity in compartment and TAD formation. These findings will contribute to refining a preliminary algorithm that can simulate chromatin organization at high resolution, giving researchers the ability to predict the effects of mutations or chromatin aberrations on TAD structure. The experiments within these aims will be initiated during the K99 phase of the award and will include training on genetic methods and the considerations necessary for working with Drosophila and C. elegans. This training will provide me with the tools and mentorship necessary for a successful transition to independent research during the R00 phase., pi  title is Jordan Rowley, rfa is community, title is Principals of Chromatin Organization", "id is /awards/U01HG007910/, type are Award, Item, description is The developmental shifts that occur when cells respond to environmental stimuli are controlled in large part by gene expression programs involving thousands of genes. Transcription factors (TFs), chromatin modifying enzymes, and cis-acting DNA elements contribute to the networks that underlie such programs. The code that links these variables in such a way that the expression of a given gene can be predicted based on the presence of specific components has yet to be deciphered. A model for such a code will be constructed here based on genome-wide analysis of human dendritic cells (DCs) as they mature in response to pathogens. DCs are antigen-presenting cells that initiate and determine the quality and magnitude of the host immune response. Recent technical advances in stem cell biology, reverse-genetic tools for primary human cells, and genome-wide assessment of transcripts, local chromatin features and long-range chromatin interactions, will be exploited here to construct a model for the transcriptional regulatory network that underlies pathogen detection and maturation in human DCs. In Aim 1, DCs will be sampled in a time-course following stimulation with LPS. Stimulation-responsive genes will be identified by RNA-Seq. Chromatin features will be mapped using ChIP-Seq, high-resolution global DNA foot printing, and Hi-C. This systematic map of all responsive genes and the regulatory regions associated with them will be combined with known DNA-binding motifs to generate an initial model for the gene regulatory network. In Aim 2 sixty transcription factors that drive transcription within the first 2 hrs of LPS stimulation will be identified from the model in Aim 1. These factors will be knocked-down in hDCs and the effect on the LPS response will be assessed using RNA-Seq. This functional data for each TF will be complemented by measurement of protein-DNA interactions using ChIP- Seq; the later will exploit CRISPR technology to fuse a common epitope tag to endogenous coding sequences for these TFs. By pinpointing key transcription factors, their binding sites, and transcriptionally-responsive genes, this analysis will be used to refine the model for the gene regulatory network. In Aim 3, a subset of cis- acting regulatory regions important for controlling the hDC transcriptional response to LPS will be identified using features collected in the previous aims. Selected loci will be perturbed using CRISPR technology and effects on target gene expression will be examined. The effect on gene expression of allelic variants in relevant loci will be assessed, using published data as well as 300 human samples that will be genotyped using Pac- Bio. In conjunction, the variance in the higher-order chromatin conformation for 50 key regulatory loci across five individuals will be assessed by 5C. These data will be used to further refine our regulatory model. The result of this analysis will be a model that highlights the key transcription factors and cis-acting components that drive gene expression in LPS-stimulated human DCs. Our findings are expected to provide a more general method for identifying the genetic determinants of gene expression in primary mammalian cells., pi  title is Jeremy Luban, rfa is GGR, title is RULES OF GENE EXPRESSION MODELED ON HUMAN DENDRITIC CELL RESPONSE TO PATHOGENS", "id is /awards/U01ES017154/, type are Award, Item, description is We propose to work cooperatively with other Mapping Centers and the Data Coordination Center (EDACC) funded by this Roadmap mechanism to comprehensively map epigenomes of select human cells with significant relevance to complex human disease. Our group, consisting of scientists at UCSF, UC Davis, UCSC and the British Columbia Genome Sciences Centre has the broad expertise that this project requires. We will focus on cells relevant to human health and complex disease including cells from the blood, brain, breast and U.S. Government-approved lines of human embryonic stem cells (aim 1). We will incorporate high quality, homogeneous cells from males and females, and two predominant racial groups, and biological replicates of each cell type. Production of comprehensive maps will include 6 histone modifications selected for their opposing roles in regulating active and inactive chromatin (aim 2), DNA methylation (aim 3) and miRNA and gene expression (aim 4). This epigenetic data, along with genetic and expression data will be integrated using advanced informatics (aim 5) to address fundamental roles of epigenetics in differentiation, maintenance of cell-type identity and gene expression. Our cell and data production pipeline will incorporate verification and data validation with independent methods, and will operate under a model motivated by increased data production and decrease cost. We summarize the analysis capacity of our instruments and our explicit strategy for data sharing of our proposed REMC-generated resources including biological specimens, protocols, data, software tools and intellectual resources. We envision that our group in conjunction with the other REMC teams, the EDACC, ENCODE, future EHHD (Epigenetics of Human Health and Disease) centers and the NIH Roadmap program will develop methods, tools and reference epigenome maps for the research community that will make the promise of epigenetics in understand and treating human complex disease a reality. Our reference epigenomes will enable new disciplines including human population epigenetics, comparative epigenomics, neuroepigenetics, and therapeutic epigenetics for tissue regeneration and reversal of disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The epigenome is the dynamic interface between our changing environment and the static genome, and understanding it is a goal of immense importance to human health. We will map reference cell epigenomes of the brain, breast, blood and approved embryonic stem cells, inclusive of males and females and different racial groups. This cooperative work will transform our understanding of the short and long-lasting consequences of environment impact on human health and disease., pi  title is Joseph Costello, rfa is Roadmap, title is INTEGRATED EPIGENETIC MAPS OF HUMAN EMBRYONIC AND ADULT CELLS", "id is /awards/R35GM133569/, type are Award, Item, description is Project Summary/Abstract Currently, transcriptome analysis by short-read RNA-seq1 is a core component of research in nearly all fields of biology. However, even specialized RNA-seq protocols cannot comprehensively identify and quantify full-length RNA transcript isoforms. Nonetheless, isoform- level resolution is essential for transcriptome annotation of model and non-model organisms. While long-read sequencing technology has the potential to overcome this challenge, current leading approaches, such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio)2 or Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)3 long-read technologies, have their own set of drawbacks that limit their wide adoption for transcriptome annotation. For example, PacBio IsoSeq cannot generate the tens of millions of reads required to determine comprehensive isoform-level transcriptomes, while ONT cDNA and direct RNA sequencing methods cannot do so at the required accuracy4. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop new short- and long-read sequencing and computational approaches. We are building on our experience with short-read technology5 to develop a new short-read cDNA sequencing method that can identify transcription start sites, polyA sites and splice sites with very high accuracy in a single easy-to-implement experiment. Currently, this requires three, separate and complex experiments. Further, we are significantly improving our R2C2 method, which is already among the most capable long-read full-length cDNA sequencing methods currently available6 (R2C2 improves on standard ONT approaches by increasing accuracy from 87% to 94% while producing more full-length cDNA sequences). To improve R2C2 further, we will increase its read accuracy to 98%, effective throughput by at least a factor of 2, and make it possible to capture very long cDNA molecules. To more accurately identify and quantify isoforms based on the resulting short- and long-read data, we will modify our Mandalorion3,6 isoform identification software to take full advantage of both data types. Together these advances will represent an integrated workflow for transcriptome annotation of unprecedented power. We will then apply this integrated workflow to improve transcriptome annotations of homo sapiens and commonly used model organisms. Generating high quality isoform-level transcriptome data for Homo sapiens, Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans will create valuable resources for biomedical research and enable us to investigate how isoform diversity has evolved and is regulated., pi  title is Christopher Vollmers, rfa is community, title is Improving Transcriptome Annotation", "id is /awards/R01HG004456/, type are Award, Item, description is Systematic efforts led by the ENCODE project are underway to characterize all functional DNA elements in the human genome. A growing amount of data generated by ourselves and others has shown that a large portion of the putative regulatory elements are localized far away from gene coding regions. This observation cannot be explained by a simple linear relationship of locations along the genome, and we are unable to address non-linear interactions between functional DNA elements using current technologies. Our goal is to develop an unbiased, whole genome approach for the identification of chromatin interactions involved in transcriptional regulation and other structural and functional roles in the genome. The principal concept of our approach is to use a specially designed DNA oligonucleotide sequence to link different DNA fragments that are non-linearly related in the genome but brought together in close spatial proximity by protein factors in vivo, and extract paired end ditag sequences from the ligated DNA fragments based on the features of the DNA linker. This is followed by mapping the tags to the reference genome sequence, hence revealing the relationship between the paired DNA fragments. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1. To develop an unbiased, whole genome approach for the characterization of long-range chromatin interactions involved in transcription regulation. We developed a prototype protocol for CIA-PET analysis that can extract ditags from the linker-ligated DNA fragments of non-linearly related DNA interactions in S. pombe cells. We will further optimize this methodology and streamline the entire process of library construction, sequencing, and data analysis. In addition, we will rigorously validate the CIA-PET data using a variety of available low-throughput technologies. 2. To adapt CIA-PET technology to mammalian genomes for the identification of long range chromatin interactions involved in transcription regulation. We plan to further improve the specificity of CIA-PET and increase its capacity to suit the need for whole genome analysis in mammalian genomes. We will validate and demonstrate the utility of CIA-PET method in 3 biological systems: a) Chromatin interactions between hemoglobin genes and regulatory elements in mouse erythroid cells. b) Tertiary networks of transcription regulation mediated by Nanog and Oct4 in mouse embryonic stem cells. c) Estrogen receptor mediated chromatin interactions in human breast cancer cells. This project will provide unprecedented insight into the mechanisms of transcription regulations allowing us to better understand how cancer cells develop and how stem cells retain pluripotency., pi  title is Yijun Ruan, rfa is ENCODE2, title is WHOLE GENOME CHROMATIN INTERACTION ANALYSIS USING PAIR-END-DITAGGING (CIA-PET)", "id is /awards/U01ES017156/, type are Award, Item, description is The overall aim of this proposal is to establish an integrated Center for creating high-quality reference maps of key epigenotypes in pluripotent, differentiating, and primary differentiated human cells and tissues. The Northwest Reference Epigenome Mapping Center aggregates leading experts in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) biology, lineage-specific differentiation of hESCs, and well-established differentiating and differentiated adult primary tissue systems to establish a substantial capacity for the production of purified cells and tissues for large-scale epigenomic studies. The Center integrates this capacity with an existing high-throughput genomics and informatics infrastructure operating at scale, creating unique synergies that enable genome-scale epigenetic analyses of high-value human primary and progenitor cell types. The Center will perform high-resolution, whole-genome profiling of foundational epigenotypes in project cell types including high-resolution quantification of chromatin structural remodeling, and analysis of DNA methylation at both actively remodeled and silenced regulatory DNA templates. The Center will also profile both small RNA species and conventional gene expression from all study cell types. The Center's informatics and analytical arm will manage project data and its release into consortium and public repositories, and will perform integrative analyses to elucidate the connection between major epigenotypes and dynamic cellular programming of gene expression., pi  title is John Stamatoyannopoulos, rfa is Roadmap, title is NORTHWEST REFERENCE EPIGENOME MAPPING CENTER", "id is /awards/R01HG003110/, type are Award, Item, description is Transcriptional regulation is extremely important and highly complex in humans. In this project, we focus on the transcriptional regulation of alternative first exons in a tissue specific manner. First exons are often poorly characterized in eukaryotic genomes. Furthermore, alternative first exons can reside in genomic locations that are far apart from each other, leading to distinct usage of proximal promoters. There are numerous examples in the literature on widely separated alternative promoters that are responsible for tissue specific expression. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that alternative splicing of first exons is indicative of alternative proximal promoter usage, which will be an important factor in our identification of functional cis-element clusters that regulate differential tissue-specific gene expressions. The project tightly couples the computational expertise in Weng's laboratory with the extremely sensitive and quantitative gene expression technique recently developed by Ding and Cantor at Boston University. We will computationally characterize all genes in the 30 Mb of human sequence selected by the ENCODE project, identify ~ 100 genes with alternative first exon splicing, study the expression levels of splicing variants in major tissue types, and investigate the cis-elements in the promoters of these genes that could account for their transcriptional regulation. The project has four specific aims: 1) Computationally analyze the ENCODE sequences and select ~100 genes that exhibit both alternative first exon usage and tissue specific expression patterns; 2) Experimentally validate first exon usage for all genes identified in Aim 1 and measure their expression levels in ten major tissue types; 3) Computationally predict cis-element clusters in the alternative proximal promoters of the genes and select ~40 most confident predictions that may account for tissue-specific expressions; and 4) Experimentally test the ~40 computational predictions using transfection assays in five cell lines., pi  title is Zhiping Weng, rfa is ENCODE, title is ALTERNATIVE PROMOTER USAGE IN TISSUE-SPECIFIC GENE EXPR", "id is /awards/Unattributed/, type are Award, Item, rfa is ENCODE, title is Unattributed"]
